# Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk 

We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. 

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 

We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2024, a 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $428 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. 

Commodity Price Risk 

We are subject to commodity price risk relating to commodity purchase contracts for items used in production that are subject to changes in the market price. We use commodity swaps and commodity purchase contracts to hedge against these potentially unfavorable price changes. Our commodity purchase contracts and derivatives are both sensitive to changes in the market price. At December 31, 2024, a 10% increase or decrease in the market price in our commodity derivatives would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $28 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of market price fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these commodity purchase contracts and the offsetting swaps do not create material market risk. 

Market Risk 

Participants in deferred compensation plans can diversify the deferred amounts among investment funds which are subject to potential changes in fair value. As of December 31, 2024, the deferred compensation liability, which is being marked to market, was $1.7 billion. A 10% change in the fair value of these investment funds would increase or decrease the liability by $168 million. Changes in the liability are recorded in operating earnings.
