A Letter From President and CEO David L. Calhoun
Everything starts with purpose. At Boeing, our mission is to protect, connect and explore our world and beyond, and it is founded on ensuring safety and quality are at the forefront of everything we do. In our first combined Sustainability & Social Impact Report, we are highlighting our progress in support of our environment, our people and our communities.
Each day, our Boeing teammates are dedicated to living our core values of safety, quality, integrity and sustainability. When it comes to the safety of Boeing’s products and services, every decision and every action matters. We are making daily progress and are holding ourselves accountable to the highest standards.
Making Strides for the Environment
We continue to work to support the commercial aviation industry’s ambition to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 by making strides in reducing our carbon
footprint. Each decision we make has a bearing on the future health of our planet, and we take the responsibility to come up with innovative solutions seriously.
It starts within our four walls. Boeing increased renewable electricity procurement by 16% in 2023, which translates to 39% renewable electricity across the enterprise through direct purchases and renewable energy credits. We also saw the highest participation rate in Boeing’s history in
our Battle of the Buildings campaign, with our teammates taking more than 1 million 60-second actions across 189 sites in 28
countries, contributing to reductions in energy use, waste to landfill and water consumption. In 2023, we hosted the first global Sustainable Aerospace Together Forum where we convened global leaders from energy, aviation, finance and policy sectors to discuss solutions for a more sustainable future. We look forward to hosting our second forum in October.
We also launched the public version of
the Cascade Climate Impact Model, a dynamic modeling tool that allows users to analyze strategies and scenarios to reduce aviation’s emissions through 2050. We
continue to refine the tool and introduce new features and insights.
Building an Inclusive Culture
People are at the center of all we do. Our 171,000 diverse teammates operate in more than 65 countries around the world, building and supporting products that connect communities and serve customers in more than 150 countries. We have manufacturing, service and technology partnerships with companies and governments worldwide and contracts with more than 11,000 suppliers.
 Our Values
Innovate and Operate
To Make the World Better
How We Operate:
Start with engineering excellence
Be accountable — from beginning to end
Apply Lean principles — eliminate traveled work Crush bureaucracy
Reward predictability and stability — everywhere in our business
How We Act:
Lead on safety, quality, integrity and sustainability
Foster a Just Culture grounded in humility, inclusion and transparency
Import best leadership practices
Earn stakeholder trust and preference
Respect one another and advance a global, diverse team

Maintaining strong relationships with these partners is critical to our business.
Within Boeing, we continue to foster an inclusive workplace where employees can have rewarding careers. We value diverse perspectives and continue to see more women and U.S. racial and ethnic minorities represented at nearly every level of the company compared with a year ago.
Boeing has nine employee-led business resource groups that connect teammates with shared interests and help our people grow personally and professionally.
We encourage employees to practice Seek, Speak & Listen habits to create an environment where all voices are heard and valued. We are strongest when teammates speak up with ideas and suggestions, and trust that appropriate action will be taken without fear of retaliation.
Transforming Our Communities
Boeing’s commitment to bringing about positive and lasting change also applies to communities around us across the globe. Our team members embody a “giving” mindset and donate time and money with a goal of improving the communities in which they live and work. We encourage
our volunteers in their efforts and match donations to accredited nonprofit organizations.
As part of our ongoing work in communities around the world, Boeing supports humanitarian and disaster relief efforts. The safety of our teammates and the communities they call home is of the utmost importance to us, and we maintain an established process to keep all channels of communication open with them throughout any crises they are facing.
We continue to nurture a healthy talent network and pipeline through volunteer efforts in support of STEM education
in schools and workforce development programs. We are also proud of the
work we do to support veterans as they transition to civilian life and in their recovery and rehabilitation journeys.
As part of this commitment, Boeing continued its partnership with the Invictus Games, an international event that brings wounded and injured service personnel together to heal through sport. Boeing currently has more than 18,000 military veterans that represent 14% of our
U.S. workforce.
Looking Ahead
Guided by our mission, we set our goals for the near term and our aspirations
for the future. We act transparently
and hold ourselves accountable every
step of the way. Our work in support of
our environment, our people and our communities involves all of us at Boeing, with safety and quality at the core. We also extend our gratitude to the local and global partnerships on these fronts that help us further our endeavors to work toward a bright tomorrow for all of our stakeholders.

A Letter From CSO Brian Moran
Transparency is core to our values and woven into how we operate at Boeing. I’m honored to join teammates from around the globe as well as my colleagues on the Executive Council to share the progress we’ve made on our environmental efforts; on diversity and inclusion; and on our positive community impact around
the world.
As Boeing’s Chief Sustainability Officer,
I am humbled to help advance our sustainability journey and promote a future that will always be anchored in safety
and quality – first and foremost. As we recommit to these fundamental values, it is energizing to see our company’s focus on helping our industry decarbonize while uplifting our communities and driving a culture of inclusion where everyone’s voice is heard.
With more than two decades at Boeing,
it’s an honor for me to bring my passion
for innovation and collaboration with global stakeholders to the CSO role. As
we strive to protect, connect and explore the world and beyond, our sustainability mission to promote an even safer and more sustainable aerospace future could not be more befitting.

See the company’s U.S. Political Advocacy Report.
Risk Management
Boeing has established processes to identify, assess, mitigate and manage risk. The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee primary responsibility for oversight of the company’s policies, practices and guidelines with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including assessing key strategic, operational and compliance risks.
Enterprise and Compliance Risk Management
Our enterprise risk management (ERM) process considers key strategic risks,
such as those relating to product safety, geopolitics, airline health, reputation, long-term competitiveness, talent and sustainability, and key operational risks, such as those relating to development program execution, supply chain, production
system health and quality, cybersecurity, liquidity, significant legal items and business continuity, as well as mitigation efforts.
Our compliance risk management (CRM) process evaluates the company’s current and emerging compliance risks, such as those relating to design and certification, production and quality, cybersecurity, industrial security, financial accounting and procurement integrity. All business units and functions participate in both the ERM and CRM on an annual basis to assess
and prioritize the most critical risks facing the company, evaluate the effectiveness
of mitigation strategies and controls, and identify important emerging risks. Both our ERM and CRM processes are continually evolving in the detection and response to risks, including through increased reliance on data. The results of the ERM and CRM processes are reviewed with both the Audit Committee and the full Board at least annually.
Safety Management System
Our Safety Management System (SMS)
is an integrating framework for managing safety risks throughout the life cycle of a product or service by identifying hazards, mitigating product safety risks, continuously improving safety performance and other activities designed to promote and sustain a positive safety culture, and shape policies that uphold our commitment to aerospace safety. The SMS infrastructure is comprised of four components designed to create a

   disciplined environment to manage safety risks and promote a positive safety culture: Safety Policy and Objectives, Safety Risk Management, Safety Assurance and Safety Promotion. Our SMS is continually evolving and improving. Our SMS includes a risk elevation process pursuant to which our business unit presidents regularly review safety risks, the associated risk mitigation and corrective action plans, and the relevant safety metrics to determine if additional resources and/or mitigation activities are necessary. Our business unit presidents determine those risks that will be briefed to our Chief Executive Officer during his SMS reviews, which occur at least bimonthly. The Aerospace Safety Committee reviews SMS performance and the SMS Risk Register at every meeting.
Risk Monitoring
The risk assessments and sustainability priorities are compared for commonality, and overlapping risks receive additional monitoring and management.
Taking Action:
• Innovation and Clean Tech, supporting our 2030 goal of 100% SAF-compatible commercial airplanes, is a key component to decarbonizing aerospace. Within the risk management process, Boeing mitigates and manages the strategic risk to this priority and goal — the ability to scale SAF supply
to meet the demand needed to achieve the commercial aviation industry’s net-zero ambitions.
• SAF as a drop-in fuel is approved to be blended at 50/50 blend with Jet A and works with existing airplanes and offers the largest potential to reduce carbon emissions over the next 20 to 30 years in all aviation segments.
• Our intent is to help catalyze SAF scaling through subject matter expertise, investments in product compatibility work, purchasing SAF for our own
fuel use and policy advocacy. In 2023, Boeing placed agreements to purchase 5.6 million gallons (21.2 million liters)
of blended SAF to support its U.S. commercial operations. Read more about our SAF scaling initiatives on Page 47.
Throughout this report, we will continue to discuss our governance, risk identification and management of our key priorities.
Business Continuity Management
Boeing strengthens its resiliency through Business Continuity Management (BCM), managing and mitigating risks should a significant incident disrupt business operations. This entails five
key preparedness initiatives: Business, Emergency, Information Technology,
Learn more about Boeing’s approach to global tax governance and compliance
Supply Chain and Human Resources working together to facilitate company resiliency. The primary objective of these initiatives is to develop and maintain guidelines, standards, processes
and tools that enable business units and functions to mitigate risk and recover critical programs, applications and suppliers.
Boeing navigated challenges in 2023 that added to the company’s risk profile, including:
• Safety and quality issues.
• Regulatory review of commercial production programs.
• Increase in supply chain risks from conflicts and geopolitical events.
BCM continues to identify risks and to implement strategies and processes to mitigate those risks to our people, programs, infrastructure, network and supply chain.
Tax Governance and Compliance
We are committed to being a responsible taxpayer wherever we operate. Our global tax team is responsible for maintaining
the highest compliance standards, being transparent in our dealings with authorities and sustaining robust internal controls for risk management. Boeing’s principled tax approach is grounded in ethical business practices and tax guidance that follows business substance.

  Ethical and Compliant Business
Code of Conduct
Safety, quality, integrity, transparency and sustainability are core values that guide the design, build and service of our products. Each year, Boeing employees affirm their commitment to these values by signing our company’s Code of Conduct. We pledge to adhere to applicable laws, regulations and company policies, serving as a powerful reminder that to earn the trust of our customers, regulators and the flying public, we must foster a workplace where we
hold ourselves accountable. That means making the right decisions, operating at the very highest standards. Members of our Board of Directors annually sign a Code of Ethical Business Conduct to affirm their commitment to Boeing’s values.
Recommitment Training
Every employee also participates in annual Recommitment training, which features real-life examples of compliance issues and consequences, and highlights how adherence to our values and doing business with integrity are critical to the company’s success.
Site Compliance and Ethics Officers
In 2023, we continued our work to enable an environment where each team member feels comfortable:
• Identifying issues.
• Seeking guidance.
• Speaking up without fear of retaliation to prevent or mitigate potential negative impacts.
Site Compliance and Ethics Officers (SCEOs) are placed at several sites across the enterprise to:
• Engage with employees and leadership teams to support an open and accountable culture.
• Identify potential risk areas, pockets of anxiety or areas for improvement.
• Connect with the appropriate employee population or elevate concerns.
This work is conducted in collaboration with site leadership and Law and Global Compliance teams, when appropriate. Through the local teams that we established with our SCEOs and Ethics Ambassador programs, we drove
improvements across our locations and business units – using site-specific data.

initiatives at various sites, which reward employees that model our values and behaviors, especially actions that pertain to strengthening safety, quality and compliance.
SCEOs, through this initiative, routinely:
• Host roundtables.
• Conduct floor walks to gain feedback from employees at all levels.
Additionally, SCEOs work with teammates outside of Law and Global Compliance who have been selected as Ethics Ambassadors and Champions. These teammates exemplify our values and spend significant time providing compliance and ethics-related resources and answering questions. Ethics Ambassadors and Champions demonstrate our values
and also gain crucial insight from other teammates, creating another avenue of actionable information.
Risk Reporting and Mitigation
Our Ethics function has a dedicated team of employees to evaluate the effectiveness of our actions, the Risk Reporting and Mitigation team. This team utilizes data compiled in the internal Inquiries and Investigations dashboard, information learned in Human Resources surveys, quarterly compliance surveys, and
information provided by SCEOs and Ethics Ambassadors/Champions.
The Risk Reporting and Mitigation team:
• Reviews quarterly survey results and other data to determine where risk may be present and then works with other groups to mitigate it.
• Completes a regular review of the ethics program to determine its effectiveness and recommends any changes that may be needed.
• Includes subject matter experts who review and work with functional teams to determine whether proposed employee activity would constitute a conflict of interest and review events, gifts or anything of value that would be given
by third parties to determine if those things would constitute an impermissible business courtesy.
• Responds to Ethics Line inquiries
and concerns, provides guidance
to employees or elevates concerns
for detailed analysis by the Issues Review Team. Ethics also works with Corporate Investigations to determine whether a raised concern should be addressed with individual corrective action, a remediation plan or both. That remediation plan could include coordination with Corporate Compliance to add or modify
existing mandatory training.
Additionally, we have prioritized and enhanced our compliance training, manager engagements and communication with employees to emphasize each teammate’s personal responsibility for compliant and ethical behavior.
Inquiries and Investigations Dashboard
Ethics monitors information available through the internal dashboard. This captures metrics based on different levels, starting at the enterprise level, by site, city, subsidiary, business group or other subsets of Boeing’s employee population.
The dashboard tracks the:
• Anonymous rate of reported cases.
• Most common ways employees reported concerns.
• Instances and topic areas of concerns that have been alleged and cases that have been substantiated.
• Amount and subject areas of inquiries.
• Number of conflicts of interest reviews submitted.
• Quantity of business courtesy reviews submitted.
• Monthly trends associated with the number of contacts to Ethics.
• Percentage of employees who have signed the Code of Conduct and completed Recommitment training, with a benchmarked goal of 99% completion each year.
Several surveys are developed throughout the year to help indicate the effectiveness of the company’s ethics and compliance programs. This includes Recommitment, quarterly compliance surveys and surveys sent to U.S.-based employees who
have raised concerns or shared ideas for improvement. SCEOs and the Risk Monitoring and Mitigation teams review the internal dashboard to determine whether engagements mitigated risk
or misconduct. Information from the compliance survey is also examined.
Stakeholder Engagement
Engagement with stakeholders is critical
to Ethics’ activities. Our teams work across functions to get employee feedback to help elevate risks and concerns and to support an ethical culture. This data is collected through various reporting platforms.

Further, Global Compliance teams interact with employees daily, receiving questions, concerns and ideas for improvement. That information is collected in our reporting database and triaged to the right subject matter experts and includes support from additional functions, site leadership or
our regulators.
Education and Awareness
The Ethics Education and Awareness team provides resources, communications and training to support all employees. They also provide localized communications where risks are identified. Additionally, they support deployment and completion tracking of the Code of Conduct and Recommitment programs. The Ethics Education and Awareness team also highlights positive Speak Up program examples through Recommitment
training and Ethics Reports.
Robust
Anti-Corruption Program
Integrity is a core company value, and we strictly forbid bribery and corruption of any kind. Our robust anti-corruption program includes extensive controls, rigorous policies and procedures, and an annual risk assessment to ensure effectiveness and identify potential enhancement opportunities.
Expectations for Employees and Suppliers
We publish an internal policy that explains our anti-corruption and anti-bribery requirements and expectations for employees. We also make guidelines
for ethical business conduct publicly available to employees and other stakeholders. The company makes employees aware of their federally protected whistleblower rights. These are designed to protect employees against retaliation for reporting potential wrongdoing by a U.S. contractor or subcontractor.
Through our Supplier Code of Conduct, we establish foundational expectations of prospective and active suppliers, including adherence to human rights standards.
Contacting Ethics
Boeing encourages employees, subsidiaries, suppliers and external stakeholders to promptly raise concerns about safety, quality or potential violations of the law or our policies. If any employee notices any cause for concern, they can reach our internal and external Ethics lines, use the confidential and anonymous web portal, or use Boeing’s Speak Up website. Learn more about how to contact Boeing Ethics.
     Enabling a Speak Up Culture
Boeing is committed to creating an environment in which its employees feel comfortable speaking up and raising issues without fear of judgment, embarrassment or retaliation. The company’s Safety Management System, which further empowers employees to identify risks and take the necessary steps to prevent accidents, injuries or loss of life, is key to a positive safety culture.
While Boeing’s Code of Conduct and related policies always have prohibited retaliation against employees who raise concerns in good faith, the company identified opportunities to strengthen and enhance these protocols and launched a stand-alone anti-retaliation policy in 2023.
This new policy explains how retaliation may appear in the workplace, providing real-world examples and information about how employees can report it. Additional new procedures require more follow up with employees who report concerns after the completion of an investigation to ensure they have not encountered retaliation for speaking up. Boeing also updated its training to further reinforce the company’s zero-tolerance policy for retaliation.
As part of Boeing’s most recent compliance survey, approximately 85% of employees who responded felt confident in the company’s enforcement of its non-retaliation policy, an increase of more than 5% since 2021. Boeing will continue its efforts to foster a culture where employees feel encouraged to speak up and know they can do so without
facing retaliation.

Enterprise Security and Data Privacy
Enabling Operations and Mitigating Cyber Threats
Boeing Enterprise Security plays a pivotal role in enabling Boeing’s operations around the world by providing a fabric of policy, standards and operating principles that support the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the company’s information systems. In an era where cyber threats are increasingly sophisticated and pervasive, we maintain an enterprise security posture that incorporates globally recognized security principles and standards and industry-leading security practices.
As part of our cybersecurity risk management processes, we conduct “tabletop” exercises and regular risk assessments to highlight areas of improvement and implement necessary controls. We continue to integrate our cyber risk processes into our Enterprise and Compliance Risks. These are overseen by
our Board of Directors and provide central, standardized frameworks for identifying and tracking cyber-related business and compliance risks across the company.
At the management level, we established a Global Security Governance Council
to further strengthen our cybersecurity risk management activities across the company. The council is responsible for developing and coordinating enterprise cybersecurity policy and strategy, and for providing guidance to key management and oversight bodies.
The council includes, among other senior executives, our Chief Security Officer, Chief Engineer, Chief Information and Data Analytics Officer, Chief Aerospace Safety Officer and Chief Product Security Engineer. Each member has several decades of business and senior leadership experience managing risks in their respective fields. This includes all aspects
of cybersecurity, data and analytics, product security engineering, enterprise engineering, safety and the technical integrity of our products and services.
Protecting Personal Information Globally
Boeing’s Global Privacy Office is dedicated to protecting the privacy of individuals
and earning and maintaining the trust
of employees, customers and the global marketplace. We are responsible for developing and implementing the
policies, strategies and capabilities designed to protect personal information. We continuously improve our program framework and embed “privacy-by-design” throughout the life cycles of our products, services and activities that process personal information.

Global Aerospace Safety and Quality
We value human life above all else, and our teammates take that personally — knowing every decision, every task must be done with transparency and accountability.
Creating a Step Change in Safety and Quality
Safety and quality are core Boeing values and fundamental to every product we design, build and support. The 737 MAX accident in January was a stark reminder that our focus on these core values must continue with actions that ensure the safety and quality of our products.
Since the pandemic, our industry has faced significant labor turnover, creating unique challenges and opportunities to shape workplace culture. We have sought the advice and counsel of more than 70,000 employees who know our products best and know where we need to improve.
We are acting on their feedback and input from customers and key stakeholders — with oversight from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration — to improve our production system and demonstrate our commitment to safety, quality and compliance in everything we do. There is still work to do, but we are making progress in the following critical areas:
Training and readiness:
We are increasing time
in training centers
for new hires in Commercial Airplanes
to get additional manufacturing systems and technical skill education. Following
their foundational training, we are
partnering them with experienced peer- mentors for structured on-the-job training to ensure confidence and proficiency in their work. Additionally, workplace coaches are being deployed to support manufacturing operations.
Simplification and production compliance: We are auditing and simplifying build plans, work instructions and installation plans to clarify processes and procedures for the team and to make it easier for them to do their work. We have implemented new product
inspections and risk assessments to control out-of-sequence work and established compliance checks as part of the team’s regular operating rhythms. We are also working with our suppliers to address defects and provide solutions at the source with more inspections and added checks prior to shipment from certain suppliers of structural components.

 “The people who depend on our products entrust us with their safety. We must ensure the safety, compliance and conformance
of our products without
compromise.”

Safety and quality culture: We are expanding our deployment of Boeing’s Safety Management System (SMS), an industry best practice used to proactively identify and address hazards within the systems used to design, build and support our products. Employee engagement, feedback and reporting of product safety hazards and concerns are vital to our safety and quality culture, and to the health of our SMS. We are seeing a significant increase in the use of Boeing’s Speak Up reporting channel, and since January, more than 70,000 employees have participated in Quality Stand Downs across our sites where we paused production and delivery for the day to focus on improving safety and quality. Additionally, more than 160,000 employees have participated in the Every Decision Matters product safety training that reinforced the importance of speaking up about concerns or mistakes, as well as the culture that supports
such transparency.
Moreover, we have commissioned an independent assessment of our safety and quality systems and practices, and we continue to make changes to our
organization to better connect our safety and quality work.
• Retired U.S. Navy Adm. Kirkland H. Donald and a team of outside experts are conducting a thorough, independent assessment of Boeing’s quality management system for Commercial Airplanes, including quality programs and practices in Boeing manufacturing facilities and its oversight of commercial supplier quality.
• In the first quarter we realigned the Internal Audit function for Commercial Airplanes Quality to report to the Chief Aerospace Safety Officer, which will further the independence of the Commercial Airplanes Quality Internal Audit team and support the direct link between safety and quality.
• Since realigning the reporting structure, we have doubled our internal product audits across all Commercial Airplanes programs.

Employee Safety
Our workplace safety strategy is built on a comprehensive policy framework and a strong commitment
to creating a safe workplace for all employees. This commitment is preserved in our Policies 1 and 2, which outline clear guidelines and procedures designed to prevent accidents and injuries. Overall, there are 16 procedure documents and 20 process documents that govern compliance with Environment, Health & Safety requirements and help engage teammates at all levels to foster a culture of safety, ensuring that safety protocols are not only understood but also integrated into daily operations. Our approach emphasizes proactive risk assessment, regular training and the implementation of innovative safety equipment and technology. We are dedicated to continuously improving our safety standards through feedback and consultation with our workforce, demonstrating our commitment to not just compliance, but excellence
in safety.
To manage and enhance the positive impacts of our safety initiatives, we
employ a robust System of Record for tracking and analyzing safety-related
data. This enables us to identify trends, pinpoint areas for improvement, and implement targeted actions to mitigate risks effectively. We conduct regular audits and reviews of our safety protocols and performance, adjusting our strategies based on the findings to ensure continuous improvement. Additionally, we celebrate and recognize the contributions of our teams toward enhancing safety standards through information sharing across the enterprise for potential replication and amplification. Through these concerted efforts and partnerships with industry
groups such as the National Safety Council, we not only comply with regulatory requirements but also go above and beyond to protect our most valuable
asset — our teammates — thereby ensuring the long-term sustainability and success of our company.
Safety is more than a priority at Boeing. It’s a core value that guides actions and decisions. Our workplace safety program, Go for Zero — One Day at a Time, is a proactive and inclusive approach to safety with the goal of a zero-injury workplace, and we recognize that the first step in preventing an injury is raising awareness and sharing knowledge. Some operations performed at Boeing are recognized
as High Hazard Processes due to their potential for a serious injury or fatality. Boeing’s Lifesaving Rules go beyond regulatory requirements and are intended to reduce or eliminate risks created when around or performing these processes and to prevent life-critical incidents by increasing accountability for following safety policies and procedures.
Our occupational health and safety management system is modeled after the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 45001. As of 2023, four sites are certified to ISO 45001 with multiple sites conforming to ISO 45001 in support of our business objectives.

 Safety Dojos Encourage Zero-Injury Workplace
In 2016, we introduced our first Safety Dojo, a walk-in safety solution center staffed by a team
of ergonomic and safety experts. It provides teammates with an opportunity to learn, collaborate and develop innovative solutions to challenging ergonomic and safety issues. Recognizing the impact the Safety Dojo has on achieving workplace safety goals, Boeing established additional
Safety Dojos bringing the total to five across the enterprise.
We also created three Safety “Dojos on the go,” which are mobile versions designed to bring safety tools and resources directly to teammates on the factory floor. The resources and activities of the Safety Dojo network go beyond compliance to create an environment where all teammates feel valued, protected and heard. This network of Safety Dojos underscores Boeing’s commitment, action and the collective responsibility of achieving a zero-injury workplace.
  “Besides sharing tools, the Dojo asks factory teammates about their safety needs and then develops innovative tools to help prevent workplace injuries.”
Craig Morgan
Environment, Health & Safety Team Lead
 At the Safety Dojo, employees can learn about everything workplace safety related and develop, share and replicate safety solutions across the Boeing enterprise.

Who We Are
Boeing employees bring their expertise to factory floors, engineering labs, flight lines and workspaces around the world, united by a mission to protect, connect and explore our world and beyond. It is our responsibility
as a company to ensure employees are valued and supported in developing their skills and careers while contributing to that important mission.
Our Shared Commitment to Inclusion
All employees sign our Code of Conduct, which includes a commitment to “build
an inclusive culture in which diverse experiences and voices are heard, respected and incorporated.” We take this pledge seriously because it’s the right thing to do, and it makes us better as a company. According to internal surveys in 2023, employees who feel included and who are part of gender-diverse teams are more likely to report their teams consistently identify opportunities to improve.
Boeing continues to seek out top talent and create inclusive teams that inspire every employee to do their best work and grow their careers. One way we aim to strengthen our company is through the Seek, Speak & Listen habits, through which employees ask for different perspectives, share ideas and concerns, and act on what they hear.
Our People
Our ability to report on the full range of diversity is limited, and while we share numbers related to gender, race and more, we know that these numbers do not fully represent the breadth of experiences, backgrounds and
identities in our workforce.
Based on what we can measure, we know that representation of women and U.S. racial/ethnic minorities has increased, including at manager and executive levels. Disability representation is also higher. And our workforce remains age diverse, comprising five generations who work with and learn from
one another.
Our Aspirations
In 2021, we established six aspirations we are striving to achieve by the end of 2025. We track our progress and identify where we have more work to do through talent data and culture surveys.

2025 Aspiration No. 1
Increase the Black representation rate in the U.S. by 20%
2025 Aspiration No. 2
Celebrate our recent progress and view our awards and recognition
  Progress
Our U.S. workforce is now 7.5% Black, a 17% rate increase from 2020.
This progress is made possible by expanding our talent pool, which we
do through our collaboration with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund and support of Historically Black Colleges
and Universities, as well as through organizations like the National Society of Black Engineers, Black Engineer of the Year Awards and Women of Color in STEM.
U.S. Black representation over 2020 baseline
We also have apprenticeship programs
for high school students interested in beginning their careers. For example, our Pre-Employment Training Program offered in St. Louis — including primarily Black communities — has graduated nearly 1,400 since its creation.
Progress
Overall racial and ethnic minority representation increased to 37.6% of our U.S. workforce in 2023, up from 35.3% in 2022, and accounted for 48.6% of our new hires. Most individual race categories saw an increase except Native American, a group that remains at a steady 0.8% of our U.S. workforce.
Our increased diversity is a byproduct of our recruitment, support and retention of top talent. In 2023, 95% of candidate slates interviewed for open manager or
executive roles in the U.S. included at
least one woman or racial/ethnic minority. We also partner with hundreds of leading professional and technical societies and organizations around the world — such
as Women in Aviation International, the Society of Women Engineers, the American Indian Science and Engineering Society, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and more — to help broaden our reach and access to top talent.

  Progress
For the third year in a row, attrition rates between women, men and people of different races have remained within nearly a single percentage point of one another. We’re working to narrow that gap further.
People tend to stay where they feel valued and know their voice matters. Our Seek, Speak & Listen habits help
to create a work environment where employees are comfortable speaking up and trust that their ideas will be heard. We’ve held listening sessions across
the company to learn directly from employees about how we can improve their experiences and support their continued career growth at Boeing. We’ve also continued investing in our people, from enhancing benefits packages to increasing training opportunities.
Progress
We continue to facilitate learning opportunities and programs that promote inclusive behaviors and strengthen teams. In 2023, our nine employee-led business resource groups (BRGs) grew by 10 chapters and 3,900 members. We also expanded the Inclusion Ambassador Network, a 3,800-employee group committed to advancing inclusion on their own teams.
By organizing a wide range of global events, initiatives and team conversations, BRG members and Inclusion Ambassadors provide a platform for open dialogue, learning, and understanding. Their efforts help break down barriers, challenge biases, and foster acceptance and appreciation in the workplace.
  In 2023, 45 employees were selected to be enterprise board leaders for our nine business resource groups.

Using culture surveys to better understand how our teams feel about their experience at Boeing, we know that we have work to do to ensure all employees, regardless of gender or race, feel they are valued and included, enabling them to do their best work.
More than 3,000 employees voluntarily completed our Building Conscious Inclusion course in 2023. In addition, teams throughout the company have access to resources related to inclusion, allyship, preventing bias and more.
Progress
This is the fourth year that we’re publishing our workforce data and progress on our aspirations. We are committed to sharing this information and responding to feedback from our employees. Additional U.S. data is available in our 2023 EEO-1 report.
This year, we’ve added data to capture the generational makeup of our global workforce. This is an important measure for us to track as we improve our knowledge-sharing efforts and foster an inclusive environment for all generations within our workforce. We will continue to report our progress going forward.
  The Power of Inclusion
Diverse teams enable everyone to perform better. As a whole, employees on teams with at least 40% women are ...
39% more likely
to say their team works to ensure everyone feels included
31% more likely
to say their team consistently identifies opportunities to improve processes, products or services
46% more likely
to say their team is committed to doing what is right
Men on gender-diverse teams were 60%-70% more likely to respond affirmatively to these statements than men on teams that are not gender-diverse.

   On a Mission To Lead
Lisa Schleuter’s interest in
aerospace began as a child,
hopping regular flights between
the United States and Germany, where her family lived for a time. An internship with Boeing sealed the deal, and she joined the company full time out of college as a structural design engineer for the 787-10 Dreamliner wing team.
After performing several engineering roles with our Commercial Airplanes production and product development teams, Schleuter earned her first leadership role as a manager. Eager to take on greater responsibility, she applied to the Leaders for Global Operations Boeing Sponsorship Program offered in partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This competitive program consists of a two-year, on-campus dual master’s degree program followed by a six-year rotation to help employees gain the experience needed for executive leadership. It’s one of the many ways we develop our next generation of leaders. Boeing provides full-time salary, housing allowance, a stipend for incidentals, and fully paid tuition.
Degrees in hand, Lisa is now back in the Puget Sound region to begin the rotation phase of the program, as the production engineering manager for the new
777-8 Freighter fuselage.
 “I will lead a team of production engineers to determine the optimal way to build the airplane efficiently and with first-time quality. I’m excited for what’s next.”

Addressing Climate Change
Boeing considers climate change to be an urgent issue. We support the goals of the Paris Agreement and encourage our value chain to do the same. Our company achieved net-zero carbon emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) at manufacturing and other work sites, and in business travel (Scope 3, Category 6) in 2023 for the fourth consecutive year, by expanding conservation and renewable energy procurement while securing third-party- verified offsets for the remaining greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Boeing strives to reduce operational GHG emissions, both during times of growth and during times of challenge. We detail our GHG strategy for Scope 1 and Scope 2 in the next section, which aligns to a 1.5 degrees Celsius pathway in support of global climate goals. We provide further details about our Scope 3 GHG emissions strategy, focusing on Use of Sold Products, starting on Page 42.
 Climate Strategy and Planning
Climate risks and opportunities inform our strategy, as evidenced by our commitments and actions in our products and operations. Moreover, the commercial aviation industry recognizes its environmental responsibilities and was one of the first
global industrial sectors to have a long- term plan to tackle climate change.
The aviation and aerospace manufacturing industries together with Boeing face significant climate change-driven risks
and opportunities as well as the need
to decarbonize for sustained long-
term growth. We believe that safe and sustainable aviation is an imperative for our commercial and governmental customers, employees and communities.
We are operating in a global environment with human, technological and natural events adding challenges to our infrastructure, business operations and long-term strategy. Now more than ever, we must identify and develop strategies
  Boeing’s ecoDemonstrator program takes promising technologies and tests them to solve real-world challenges for airlines, passengers and the environment.

that minimize the consequences and impact of potential threats or disruptions.
We believe our business strategy is resilient to a changing climate, given sustained focus and investment in our products, services and operations, as well as enhanced risk management practices for global operations. Environmental assessments have informed our due diligence as we consider property transactions and the design of future products and infrastructure. For more information about our approach to climate change, see our TCFD Index.
GHG Strategy for Operations
Boeing’s decarbonization strategy
across its manufacturing sites and other operations facilities prioritizes avoiding and reducing direct emissions first via efficiency improvements, conservation and renewable energy procurement. Third- party verified offsets were used in 2023 and since 2020 to mitigate Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions Boeing could not first avoid, reduce or replace. We remain committed to supporting the commercial aviation industry’s net zero 2050 ambition, which starts inside our four walls.
To achieve our sustainable operations goals related to GHG, we actively monitor emissions, fuel use and energy efficiency and track our performance as
we increase adoption of renewable energy sources and implement energy efficiency improvements. As part of Boeing’s business continuity program, we also monitor the length and severity of business interruptions due to climate or weather- related events. The scope of monitoring includes damaging weather and natural disasters, as well as public health crises, and helps us understand how to increase resiliency in light of a changing climate.
Enterprise GHG emissions from operations are calculated after the conclusion
of the reporting year. However, the emissions from natural gas and electricity procurement at Core Metric Sites, which represent the majority (70%) of Boeing’s GHG footprint from operations, are calculated and monitored on a monthly basis through the use of utility bills and
are continuously validated and updated throughout the reporting year. The emissions factors for these energy sources are validated at least annually and updated when appropriate following guidance
from the World Resources Institute GHG Protocol. The energy data and emissions factors are verified as part of a third-party limited assurance process. For more information about our GHG reporting, see the GHG Emissions Supplement.

energy and emissions reduction projects across the company. This proactive approach supports Boeing in achieving the sustainable operations goals we have set for GHG emissions reduction, energy procurement and energy conservation, see Page 53 to learn more about
our progress.
’Avoid First, Remove Second’ Strategy
Our strategy is to prioritize avoiding Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions in the first place, including through increasing use
of renewable electricity and SAF in our operations, as the most direct way to reduce our carbon footprint. For emissions that are hard to abate, we plan to increase focus and investment in permanent carbon removal.
For the past four years, we have voluntarily offset our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions across manufacturing sites and other operations facilities, in addition to our Scope 3, Category 6 – Business
Travel emissions.
Our 2023 offset purchases were guided by the following principles:
• Certified by top global verification organizations that ensure the offsets meet minimum criteria of being measurable, additional, independently verified and uniquely numbered and tracked on a registry with a diversified portfolio by geography and project type to reflect global company presence.
• Use of aviation-sector Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA)
credits for all offsets covering business travel (air and rental car).
In 2024, Boeing will evolve from using offsets for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions to support our longer-view carbon management strategy of avoid first, remove second. To “avoid first,”
we will continue to prioritize preventing carbon emissions from getting into the atmosphere in the first place by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels within operations by continuing to invest in renewable energy and energy-efficient infrastructure – such as heating and cooling systems and LED lighting in factories – and encouraging resource conservation.
To “remove second,” we will diversify our investments in permanent carbon removal to strengthen our offset portfolio over time and support important tech development,
which will support the long-term success of the voluntary carbon market. Boeing plans to continue to offset our business travel emissions, over time increasing the proportion of permanent removals. We will also continue to report our Scope 3, Category 11 GHG emissions (Use of Sold Products) to
our stakeholders.
As we continue efforts to decarbonize aviation, increase renewable energy procurement and focus on conservation behaviors in our operations, traditional carbon offsets, including nature-based projects, will continue to play an important role for Boeing and its customers.

Decarbonizing Aerospace, Together
Our company and the aerospace industry recognize finding solutions to decarbonize commercial aviation as an urgent challenge of our time. We are united in our commitment to ensure billions of passengers can continue to fly every year to connect with friends and family, discover new places and cultures, engage in commerce, and care for those in need.
Achieving this objective requires a portfolio of innovative solutions and collaborations that allows our sector to decarbonize. We have been focused on four key areas: fleet renewal, operational efficiency, renewable energy, advanced technology — and in 2023, we added an additional focus area: market-based measures.
Strategy for Decarbonizing Aerospace
On Earth Day in 2008, leaders within the commercial aviation industry committed
to action on climate change. Together we aimed to build upon the industry’s strong track record of technological progress
and innovation by identifying the need to accelerate action to mitigate environmental impact, while driving sustainable development. To address these needs, industry leaders agreed to a strategy to encompass alternative fuels, fuel efficiency, routes and infrastructure and economic instruments. Collaboration remains a crucial part of our strategy to address climate change.
Since that time, we have continued to evolve our approach. Our multi-pronged effort minimizes transition risk by providing customers with climate-responsible flight. Our industry’s efforts have significantly reduced the CO2 emissions per passenger on a flight today compared with the same flight 30 years ago. These efforts have kept the commercial aviation industry’s share
of global emissions at about 2.5% before COVID-19 while demand nearly tripled. Boeing and the industry remain committed to supporting commercial aviation’s climate ambition of reaching net-zero emissions
by the middle of the century.
Supporting the commercial aviation industry’s 2050 ambitions, we focus on
Use of Sold Products (Scope 3, Category 11), which is estimated to be greater than 90% of the company’s total GHG emissions inventory, and therefore defined as the only relevant category of Scope 3 emissions
for Boeing under the Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Company Benchmark. Due to
the unique aspects of our sector, including global scope, long product life span, and financial and technological decarbonization challenges, Scope 3, Category 11 emissions are best addressed as a collaborative effort across the industry. In support of a net-zero transition, the first step is to work together to identify a credible path aligned with the commercial aviation industry in support
of its global reduction goals.

 Boeing Publicly Launches ’Cascade’ To Support Commercial Aviation’s Net-Zero Ambition
Explore and learn more about our Cascade Climate Impact Model
In May 2023, the Company released the Boeing Cascade Climate Impact Model for public use. “Cascade” for short is a data modeling tool that quantifies the potential of commercial aviation’s strategies to reduce carbon emissions. The tool is accessible here.
The data modeling tool allows exploration of airplane fleet renewal, operational efficiency, renewable energy sources, future aircraft,
and market-based measures as pathways to decarbonization. Cascade examines the full life cycle of alternate energy sources for commercial aviation – from production through distribution
and use – and can help inform the most impactful and effective strategies for commercial aviation to reach its sustainability targets.
The tool is designed to be a resource for stakeholders to make more informed decisions about commercial aviation’s decarbonization efforts.
Boeing also introduced the Cascade User Community, a working group that will provide feedback on new features, functionalities and application programming interfaces. The founding members of the Community are IATA, NASA,
University of Cambridge’s Aviation Impact Accelerator and the MIT Laboratory for Aviation and the Environment.
After launch, Boeing worked to roll out new features and enhancements to the tool, based on user feedback. Today, the team continues to engage its users in order to evolve the tool and enhance its usefulness.
  The Boeing Cascade Climate Impact Model assesses the potential of each of aviation’s strategies to cut emissions.

 Renewable energy can help reduce carbon emissions from our operations and from our products and services.
For our products, renewable energy
can help reduce the carbon intensity
of an energy carrier powering our products, such as SAF, green hydrogen and batteries. Boeing believes SAF is a necessary lever to decarbonize aviation.
However, it will take a “SAF and” approach and not a “SAF or” approach to support the commercial aviation industry’s ambition for net zero by 2050. As part
of the “SAF and” approach, Boeing continues to advance the viability of other renewable energy carriers and their safe use on aircraft.
Decarbonizing Aerospace Strategy No. 3
Renewable Energy
Strategy in Action
Tracking Expected SAF Pathway
We believe SAF offers the largest potential to reduce life cycle carbon emissions in all aviation segments over the next 30 years, based on several studies and tools including the Boeing Cascade Climate Impact Model. Boeing also publicly released the SAF Dashboard, a tool that tracks expected SAF capacity over the next decade by production pathway, location and other metrics.
For nearly 20 years, Boeing has been pioneering global efforts to make the use of SAF a reality, and today, our efforts are more energized than ever.
In 2023, Boeing further demonstrated its commitment to catalyze the SAF industry through seven new collaborations. Boeing placed agreements to purchase 5.6 million gallons (21.2 million liters) of blended SAF to support its U.S. commercial operations.

Boeing Collaborates With Equatic on Carbon Removal Technology
In May 2023, Boeing partnered with Equatic, a carbon dioxide removal company, to support permanent carbon dioxide removal and green hydrogen production.
Under the collaboration, Boeing entered into a pre-purchase option agreement where Equatic will remove 62,000 metric tons of CO2 and will deliver 2,100 metric tons of carbon-negative hydrogen, or green hydrogen.
The first and primary use of hydrogen in aviation should be used to develop and scale SAF, and Boeing intends to use Equatic’s green hydrogen to support the industry’s need to scale SAF.
Equatic is developing a process that will use seawater, air, rock and renewable electricity to remove carbon and produce green hydrogen. Boeing’s commitment to Equatic is
part of a larger carbon management strategy that prioritizes an avoid-first, remove- second approach. Equatic technology will play an important role to unlock global-scale decarbonization solutions and will allow Boeing to improve its offset portfolio durability over time. Boeing will diversify investments in permanent carbon removal to strengthen our offset portfolio over time and support important tech development, supporting
the voluntary carbon market.
 “As a hard to decarbonize sector, we recognize that many solutions will be needed for commercial aviation to achieve its net-zero commitment, and Equatic offers one of those solutions. Both carbon removals and green hydrogen will be necessary to support the scale up of SAF
and decarbonize aviation.”

 4 Strategies To Advance Sustainable Operations
                 Innovation and Engagement
Boeing encourages our workforce
to support conservation by fostering sustainable behaviors. Employees are a source of innovation and champions of projects that contribute to Boeing’s goals. Sustainability is embedded within the Boeing Production System and linked
to Lean methodologies that eliminate waste and promote more efficient and sustainable practices. We provide sustainability training and recognition programs to help employees develop sustainable habits.
Efficiency and Conservation
We value natural resources and believe
in using them responsibly. We drive reductions by implementing measures to reduce resource consumption and waste generation. Efficiency and conservation are integral to achieving our sustainable operations targets (see Page 53) based on absolute measures to reduce emissions, energy use, water, solid waste and hazardous waste. We focus on optimizing the performance of our buildings and equipment to enable sustainability
as a natural outcome.
Site and Infrastructure Investment
As we modernize and upgrade our infrastructure and processes, we seek to improve efficiency, extend the useful life of equipment, and reduce avoidable resource use, resulting in lower life cycle cost. We pursue LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification for new construction projects and implement targeted solutions to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Our commitment to renewable electricity is the primary lever to achieve our operational greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. We have made substantial strides in transitioning facilities to 100% renewable electricity, achieving 39% renewable electricity procurement through direct purchases and renewable energy credits in 2023.
Resilience and Risk Management
Boeing is proactively working to drive site and operational resilience to
adapt in a dynamic environment and address climate change impacts such
as extreme weather and drought by identifying areas of risk and associated mitigation strategies. Environmental compliance, protection and restoration are cornerstones of our operations.

  Sustainable Operations Strategy No. 1
Innovation and Engagement
We have implemented multiple approaches to encourage the workforce to support conservation by fostering sustainable behaviors. Employees are a source of innovation, champions of projects, and their combined actions contribute to achieving our goals.
Strategy in Action
Engaging Employees in Conservation
Our annual Battle of the Buildings competition set a new global participation record as employees performed more than 1 million 60-second sustainable actions to conserve water, energy and reduce waste and greenhouse gases across 189 Boeing sites in 28 countries.
“Each action taken helps us reduce our environmental footprint, while engaging employees to participate in conservation actions they can do in their daily work,” said Jill Graftenreed, vice president, Global Enterprise Sustainability. “Collectively, we far exceeded our original goal and surpassed our stretch goal thanks to the employees’ enthusiastic response and commitment to the protection of the environment.”
About the competition: The fifth annual 2023 Battle of the Buildings competition, part of the EPA’s ENERGY STAR Program, ran from April 21 to May 31.
• The goal was to reach 350,000 actions.
• It had a stretch goal of 700,000 and raised again to 1 million 60-second actions.
The programs that we utilize to get employees involved and contribute to
the enterprise sustainability goals are designed to reach all aspects of the workforce. Elements of sustainability are embedded within the Boeing Production System and linked to Lean methodologies that eliminate waste and promote more efficient, sustainable practices within operations. Additionally, we provide behavior change training and encourage recognition programs to help employees develop sustainable habits and be rewarded for their efforts.
The approaches used include elements
of gamification, which turn sustainable behaviors into fun and engaging programs. Key employee engagement avenues include:
• The Conservation Best Practices program, which is deployed across the enterprise to prioritize reducing energy, water and waste at our largest areas
of operation.
• The ENERGY STAR Battle of the Buildings competition encourages employees to work together toward our sustainability goals and promote a culture of environmental stewardship.
• Aerospace Sustainability Foundations Training, an internal credential training that allows employees to learn more about sustainable aerospace and practices and how they can incorporate them into their work.
• The Environmental Sustainability Leadership Awards (ESLA) have played a pivotal role in recognizing and quantifying our achievements in sustainability.
By emphasizing employee engagement throughout the sustainability
programs, we benefit local communities and use the
   capabilities of our diverse workforce to achieve operational sustainability goals.

Managing Waste Materials
We are making strides to protect the
land, water and air in our communities
by reducing waste from work sites and
our supply chain. Waste streams are as complex as our facilities, which range from office space to part fabrication to assembly of aircraft and space vehicles. Solid waste includes material that has been discarded or abandoned or that is no longer useful
or usable and has been designated for removal. Items that are reused are excluded from this category. We have dedicated teams working to prevent waste from going to landfills and to assess opportunities to return or reuse parts packaging.
Management of Hazardous Waste and Chemicals
We work to responsibly manage hazardous waste and chemicals in the value chain. We generate hazardous waste primarily from a variety of research, manufacturing and facilities maintenance processes. Hazardous waste disposal may be reduced upstream and downstream through on-site or off-site regeneration of consumable chemicals and through processes that extend the useful life of those chemicals
to avoid hazardous waste. We look to reduce hazardous waste in upstream
activities by preventing or reducing the amount of hazardous waste generated through extending system life through contaminant removal. Downstream, we look at hazardous waste generated from site operations. We implement several recycling and recovery activities to reduce the need for new chemicals.
Reducing Water Use
We set water use reduction targets at
our manufacturing sites to preserve this natural resource for the environment and our communities. Our water is sourced from local public utilities (surface, ground and reclaimed water) and company generation (on-site well, on-site reclamation and rain capture). This sourced water supports manufacturing, sanitation, drinking
water, cooling and irrigation across the company. The majority of our water is from public water supply systems, and most withdrawal measurement is from water system meters. Water used within our facilities is discharged to public sanitary sewer systems. In some cases, we pre-treat wastewater before discharging it to public sanitary sewer systems, in compliance
with regulatory requirements. We do not set voluntary effluent discharge standards beyond those set by regulation.
Our specialists work to identify efficiencies, best practices and new technologies to reduce water use. We work to identify irregularities that may require action and created a Conservation Best Practice program to minimize water use, applying many water management techniques recommended by the EPA.
Working To Conserve Water
We implement efficiencies, best practices and new technologies to reduce water use and identify alternatives for water-intensive processes. We regularly review industry best practices and use the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 standard to target continuous improvement opportunities, enhance environmental performance, meet compliance obligations and achieve reduction goals. We engage diverse stakeholders including customers, nongovernmental organizations and company leadership for their direct input and perspectives. This information helps
us identify and update our understanding of current and emerging sustainability issues critical to the company and our stakeholders. It also informs our next- generation environmental strategy
and targets.

In 2023, Boeing invested $15 million in projects that significantly reduced energy use.
Three years ago, Boeing’s Global Real Estate & Facilities initiated the Global Enterprise Sustainability Fund and has significantly increased investment in 2024 to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions within the company’s operations.
Part of Boeing’s sustainable operations strategy is using energy performance contracting (EPC), a financing technique that uses energy cost savings from reduced consumption to repay the cost of installing the conservation measures. LED lighting, for example, can pay for today’s facility upgrades with tomorrow’s energy savings. EPC can also help compliance with regulatory requirements, most notably the Washington Clean Buildings Act and the Washington Climate Commitment Act.
Additionally, managers and employees credit the lighting upgrade for benefiting employees’ work environment, which improves morale and workplace safety.

  Sustainable Operations Strategy No. 4
Resilience and Risk Management
At Boeing, environmental compliance, protection and restoration are cornerstones of our operations. We maintain strong relationships with regulators, communities and other stakeholders to prioritize responsible remediation practices and actions that contribute meaningfully to the health and vitality of our planet.
Remediation
Boeing’s remediation program is
focused on using innovative cleanup technologies coupled with the use of constructive input from community members and environmental groups to ensure the protection of human health and the environment. This approach, combined with the guidance of leading environmental scientists and state and federal regulatory agencies, has led to great progress in cleaning up remediation sites. Boeing also often collaborates with wildlife and conservation organizations to restore habitat for the benefit of wildlife and the community.
Boeing owns thousands of acres of habitat at five locations across the country that are being protected or restored.
Each habitat is actively managed and maintained by site employees, nonprofit organizations or contract biologists. For some locations, additional agreements and monitoring are in place to ensure
all legal, contractual and certification requirements are met. Each habitat is certified by the Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC), with three certified at the Gold level. The WHC’s certification program is the only voluntary sustainability standard designed for broad-based biodiversity enhancement and conservation education activities on corporate landholdings.
We publicly share important information on our most significant remediation activities on our website.
Environmental Compliance
A fundamental element of our environmental policy is to maintain regulatory compliance. When noncompliance is identified in our environmental management systems,
we evaluate and analyze the incident, implement corrective actions and share process improvements to build the learning into the organization.

Sustainable Product Life Cycle
We are continuously evolving our product life cycle approach to consider the full breadth of sustainability – including environmental, health, safety and human factor improvements – by targeting the following seven areas:
End of Service
Up to 90% of parts and materials on metal aircraft can be reused or recycled
Use
Providing customer solutions to lower carbon emissions
while using our products
Demand/Sales
Meeting emerging sustainability and efficiency standards
Design/Technology
Using life cycle assessments to determine if new product designs and technologies are safe and sustainable
Materials/Feedstocks
Using nature-based, lightweight, regenerative
and efficient materials
           Build/Test
Parts
Reducing waste and using renewable energy in operations and flight tests
Reducing CO2 emissions and waste from parts, components and systems
  Encouraging Commercial Aviation To Adhere To Gold Standards in End-of-Service Recycling
Our sustainable product life cycle ensures we exceed customer expectations to build in sustainability from design to recycling at the end of service.
In 2005, we helped found the Aircraft Fleet Recycling Association (AFRA) to set best practices for the safe and sustainable disassembly of commercial aircraft, engines and recycling assets.
In 2023, we signed a pledge to work exclusively with organizations accredited by
AFRA to ensure airplanes in the Boeing-owned fleet are dismantled and recycled in an environmentally responsible manner. Many dismantlers in North America and Europe are AFRA accredited. We are focused on enabling this ecosystem and support the continued growth of AFRA accreditation, which meets the highest standards of sustainability.
AFRA Best Management Practices guide aircraft component sorting into waste and recycling streams and outline practices for draining and disposing of fluids in a responsible manner.
Recycling procedures also help keep valuable components in the closed-loop among aerospace manufacturers, fleet owners, dismantlers and recyclers supporting a sustainable product life cycle.
We are collaborating with AFRA to find recycling solutions to support a robust and sustainable second-life market for composite aircraft materials.

Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct framework.
Commitments and Actions on Human Rights
We are committed to the protection and advancement of human rights in our global operations and supply chain. We do not tolerate any form of modern slavery, child labor or other human rights infringements. We have a policy and practices designed to identify and address human rights risks; they are reviewed annually via Boeing’s Compliance Risk Management program. We also expect similar behaviors from
our suppliers, which we articulate in our Supplier Code of Conduct. We actively monitor for human rights risks in our
supply chain and participate in an industry approach to further our risk assessment, when warranted. Supplier misconduct concerns can be anonymously reported to Boeing’s Ethics line. Modern slavery annual statements for Boeing United Kingdom and Boeing Australia are available for review.
Supply chain sustainability encompasses embedding environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations in our supply chain management practices. These practices continuously evolve to ensure relevant topics are prioritized
and associated compliance obligations addressed. With regard to environment, we have implemented a raw materials circular economy construct and streamlined inventory management and supplier packaging to reduce waste. We have
also worked with suppliers to develop technologies that enable product-level environmental objectives. Pertaining to social sustainability, sourcing to diverse suppliers and addressing human rights risks have been long-standing fundamental priorities. Finally, in the governance space, we have established clear procurement authority to mitigate corruption risk, encouraged supplier transparency on their sustainability practices and implemented
a sustainability category in our Supplier of the Year program.
We understand that relevant topics may evolve for our industry or procurement categories, and engage in industry voluntary approaches, where relevant, to have a meaningful positive impact. The
International Aerospace Environmental Group (IAEG) is a pivotal global industry forum in which we participate to address sustainability matters across our supply base. It is comprised of 56 members representing 70% of 2022 aerospace industry revenue addressing relevant sustainability topics. The IAEG’s efforts via Aerospace Industry ESG Engagement working group 11 has helped implement a voluntary sectoral framework for sustainability engagement, including assessment and awareness. In 2023,
this working group selected a global leading service provider, Ecovadis, to power a voluntary industry sustainability assessment program, grew participation
to 10 IAEG member companies (including Boeing), and achieved over 1,000 supplier assessments in an industry data pool. We also participate in the International Forum on Business Ethical Conduct (IFBEC).
This group established an aerospace and defense industry model supplier code of conduct and Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) for our conflict minerals due diligence management approach.
We continuously focus on efforts to deploy the IAEG sustainability assessment program. This is an effort to further supply

 Supply Chain ESG Risk Management Framework
The OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct (OECD, 2018) recommends a six-step due diligence process shown below. Boeing’s supply chain sustainability management approach is aligned to this process model to effectively address human rights and other ESG risks in our supply chain through a combination of adopting industry voluntary approaches and Boeing-specific practices.
Learn how our Ethics reporting lines are available to report supplier concerns
    Communicate how impacts are addressed
Continue communicating Boeing’s sustainability reporting and regulated human rights disclosures.
52 1
Embed responsible business conduct
Boeing’s supply chain sustainability management approach includes deployment of governance documents applicable to our suppliers (external) and employees (internal). Regarding suppliers, the Boeing Supplier Code of Conduct, coupled with related supplier contract terms and conditions, establishes consistent and clear expectations for responsible and sustainable conduct. Our procurement practices are rooted in fair and impartial interactions with suppliers, and
only designated procurement
agents have the authority to
commit us to purchase contracts.
Identify and assess adverse impacts
By participating in the IAEG Aerospace Industry ESG Engagement (WG11) program, Boeing is able to conduct a two-part risk identification and assessment method. First, use a global data
set of companies screened on sustainability in relevant industries to generate a predictive ESG risk profile of Boeing’s suppliers. Second, select suppliers for a robust assessment of sustainability management practices via IAEG’s program based on their predictive ESG risk profile and/or strategic importance.

Provide for or cooperate in remediation when appropriate
Boeing has an enterprise remediation plan to address substantiated human rights violations in
our supply chain. Implementation is tailored to the violation and includes ongoing communication with relevant stakeholders and authorities.

  Track implementation and results
Cease, prevent or mitigate adverse impacts
By participating in the IAEG program, Boeing supply chain employees and suppliers have a digital workflow solution to review sustainability assessment results, identify areas for potential improvement and define next steps supplemented by educational materials and webinars. Boeing anticipates implementing this aspect of our management approach in 2024 as supplier sustainability assessments are completed.
Boeing’s supply chain sustainability management approach will establish metrics in 2024 for tracking year over year change. We anticipate metrics that enable transparency of 1) the scope and progress of our management approach and 2) Boeing supplier sustainability performance trends.

Boeing’s ongoing commitment to the communities where Boeing employees live and work includes disaster relief efforts. In 2023, Boeing and its employees — with a boost from the Boeing Gift Match Program — provided $5 million to disaster response
and humanitarian efforts globally. This includes $500,000 to the American Red Cross (pictured) and Hawai’i Community Foundation’s Maui Strong Fund to assist with disaster recovery and relief efforts in Hawaii following deadly wildfires that have devastated Maui communities.
“Our thoughts are with those in need after the devastating wildfires swept through Hawaii. We are so grateful for partners like Boeing as we work together to provide help and hope for communities in the wake of these catastrophic wildfires.” – Anne McKeough, American Red Cross, chief development officer
Ensuring Equitable Access
Australia | Vietnam | Canada
Boeing works with partners around the world to uplift Indigenous communities and other underserved groups as part of our commitment to racial equity and social justice.
In 2023, the company continued its multiyear partnership with the Stars Foundation in Australia through a grant that helped improve health, education and employment outcomes for First Nations girls and young women in more than 53 primary and secondary schools (pictured).
In Vietnam, Boeing supports The VinaCapital Foundation program, which provides a safe environment for female
students to share their stories, improve
their socioeconomic understanding, better
comprehend their unique individual and collective community values, and create a platform to develop their employment skills.
In Canada, Boeing funded the 2023 Indigenous STEAM Summer Camp at the University of Winnipeg. In addition to learning about coding, digital media creation and 3D design, students learn about traditional Indigenous ceremonies, creation stories, star teachings and more.
Commitment to History
South Carolina | Tennessee
In June 2023, the International African American Museum hosted a grand opening, including a community celebration, presented by Boeing. Participants enjoyed live music, artists, food and Boeing’s STEM activity, DreamLearners (pictured). Boeing has committed $2 million to the museum since 2011, which will make it possible for children and their families to experience the museum for free. The museum seeks to honor the untold stories of the African American journey by educating visitors about the trauma and triumph that gave rise to a resilient people.
Boeing also provided funding for the renovation of the National Civil Rights Museum to expand educational programs and exhibits. The renovation
is scheduled for completion in 2025. Boeing funding supports the physical growth of this iconic institution but also symbolizes our collective commitment to fostering a more inclusive and equitable society.
 “Our partnership with Boeing helped more than 3,000 First Nations young women access the Stars Foundation’s engagement program, empowering them to make choices about their pathway to further study or employment.”

1. Water data represents approximately 84% of operations by square footage based on our Core Metric Sites established in 2017 and does not consider operational changes in the interim period. 2. Water-stressed areas are those with high or extremely high water stress in the World Resources Institute Aqueduct Model.
3. Boeing does not have withdrawals from produced/entrained water sources. As a result, it is deemed not relevant.
4. Boeing does not withdraw brackish surface water/seawater for direct operations. As a result, it is deemed not relevant.
5. Boeing stores water for emergency fire suppression. There is no significant change in water storage quantity from year to year. As a result, it is deemed not relevant 6. Although Boeing monitors water withdrawal volumes, there is no systematic monitoring of discharge volumes except when required by facility-level permits.
As a result, water consumption volumes are not monitored, as it is the difference between withdrawal (monitored) and discharge (not monitored in its entirety). 7. In previous reports, this was referred to as “off-site water sources.”

Boeing invested $48.5M in charitable grants supporting STEM education and workforce development. Including charitable grants, sponsorships and the Boeing Gift Match Program, Boeing contributed a total of $74.4M in STEM education and workforce development programs. Data reflects the reporting period of November 2022 through October 2023 to account for a full Board of Directors year.
Inquiries comprise Requests for Guidance and Information Requests. Requests for Guidance are situations where workforce members are seeking guidance when facing ethical dilemmas or when
they need assistance in understanding company policies or expected behaviors. Information Requests are situations where workforce members are seeking general information. Both demonstrate awareness
of Boeing’s Compliance and Ethics program, but Requests for Guidance are viewed as the most positive types of contact.
Investigated matters are considered unsubstantiated when investigation findings demonstrate that no misconduct occurred or where there is a lack of evidence to support a finding of misconduct.

In January 2024, the Boeing Sukanya Program launched. The program aims
to support the entry of more girls from across India into the country’s growing aviation sector, and it will provide opportunities for girls and women from across India to learn critical skills in STEM fields and train for jobs in the aviation sector. For young girls, the program will create STEM Labs at 150 planned locations to help spark interest in STEM careers. The program will also provide scholarships to women who are training to be pilots. Investments will support flight training curriculum, obtaining certifications, funding for simulator trainings, and career development programs.
In January 2024, Boeing opened a new state-of-the-art Boeing India Engineering & Technology Center (BIETC) campus in Bengaluru. Built with an investment of INR. 1,600 crore, the 43-acre campus is Boeing’s largest such investment outside the U.S., and will become a cornerstone for collaborating with India on next- generation products and services for the global aerospace and defense industry.
In November 2023, Boeing and the United States launched an initiative to catalyze the development and use of SAF among Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) member countries. The initiative will address potential challenges for APEC economies in creating and growing nascent SAF markets and builds on Boeing’s work to help scale SAF globally through industry collaboration and policy advocacy, investments in product compatibility work and Boeing’s own purchase of millions of gallons of SAF for its commercial operations.

Interactions with water as a shared resource
GSI uses plants, soil, and stone to filter and reduce the amount of polluted water that enters sewers and waterways. When thoughtfully designed, GSI can reduce flooding and pollution caused by stormwater runoff, increase neighborhood green space, and contribute to other climate-resilient community benefits.
Boeing’s direct use of freshwater is primarily comprised of 1) potable and sanitary use, 2) direct contact use, and 3) non-contact use. First, freshwater quantity and quality are both important to support essential daily potable and sanitary uses across all site operations. Secondly, direct contact use typically includes metal finishing, paint and wash operations, quality assurance activities, and other uses that involve direct contact between the product and freshwater (whether further treated on-site or not). Freshwater quantity and quality are thus important for direct contact use as well because they can directly impact core production activities. Thirdly, non-contact cooling makes up a substantial percentage of
the overall freshwater intake at a typical Boeing facility. It is also important that sufficient, good-quality freshwater from municipal supplies is available to ensure stable cooling system operations to minimize risks of interruption.
A review was conducted for facilities included in this reporting boundary to determine their water withdrawal sources. These sources and water bodies were then correlated with the WRI Aqueduct Tool to determine and quantify extent of water stress for the respective Boeing facility. The amount of water withdrawn from areas with water stress was used with Boeing’s total water withdrawal volume to calculate the percentage. Boeing’s operations in these areas of
water stress are restricted to general manufacturing and assembly. Large-scale fabrication using tank lines, which has a much higher water intensity, is focused in different geographical regions that are not deemed areas of high water stress.
Boeing has initiated water balance studies to quantify water use at the
facility level, in several key areas of direct operations, including potable and sanitary use, direct-contact production, non-contact cooling/HVAC, and other miscellaneous uses with special focuses on top water-consuming
sites and sites located in water-stressed areas. Water balance studies
help identify focus areas to improve water use efficiency and maximize quantitative improvement outcomes. Boeing’s global enterprise sustainability team collaborates with the contract management team to engage with
water treatment service suppliers, who are contractually required to identify and propose water-related cost savings opportunities every quarter.

Interactions with water as a shared resource
Including such requirement into the suppliers’ performance evaluation matrix allows Boeing the opportunity to regularly screen proposed projects and
secure internal and external resources to implement them. Boeing strategically requires sites that make up the top 80% of Boeing’s water withdrawal volume
to implement Conservation Best Practices (CBP). CBP are low-cost operational and/or behavioral initiatives that reduce water use and associated utility costs. Key components of this initiative include developing site-level conservation plans and sharing the plans with key decision makers. In addition to infrastructure- related improvements listed elsewhere, the CBP also focus on finding and fixing water leaks and requiring all major sites to have a water use reduction project specific to its operations.
Boeing’s 2025 target is to reduce absolute water withdrawal by 25% from 2017 levels, for the operational boundaries of the Core Metric Sites, which represent the majority (70%) of Boeing’s operations. The company 2025 target integrates a water reduction strategy, and we will be sharing more on 2030 goals in our next reporting cycle. Water-related risks, issues, and opportunities are part of the plan, which includes reducing withdrawal, improving discharge quality, water risk management, and resiliency planning. Boeing’s strategy to mitigate issues is to reduce water withdrawal through the following practices: prioritize high-impact projects, enhance evaporative cooling efficiencies, incorporate water efficiency into project designs, and improve water discharges. Water and wastewater budgets are forecast five years into the future for financial and conservation planning purposes. Boeing has reserved conservation project funding under the Global Enterprise Sustainability organization, and water conservation project costs are covered under this funding pool.
The nature of Boeing’s manufacturing requires sufficient quantities and strict qualities of parts and materials acquired through its direct supply chain (parts and materials that directly comprise Boeing’s products). Thus, it is important that sufficient good-quality freshwater be available to suppliers whose production processes and technologies rely on it, as such availability indirectly impacts Boeing’s value chain. Among Boeing’s vast upstream supply chain, various suppliers may have drastic differences in their business’s exposure and sensitivity to water-related risks.

Because Boeing currently has very limited engagement with our supply chain
on water-related matters, a quantitative conclusion cannot be made due to
lack of visibility of supplier data. However, should any direct suppliers identify
and present water risks that are substantive enough to threaten supply quality, quantity, pricing, or schedule, Boeing would evaluate its exposure to the identified situation per internal financial and strategic risk management procedures. For this reporting year, no known substantive water risk was presented by any suppliers to Boeing. To enhance our risk assessment processes on water-related issues and to demonstrate environmental stewardship, we collaborated with other industry partners beginning in 2022 through the IAEG.
Indirect water use of Boeing’s products may vary by purpose and quantity; however, freshwater availability is still important for commercial airplane operations and defense product use. Boeing provides a Qualified Parts List (QPL) of aircraft wash products that airlines can choose, and our guidance includes dry washing procedures.
Boeing does not withdraw brackish surface water/seawater for direct operations.
Boeing only monitors water discharges at the facility level for compliance purposes when required by discharge permits. As a result, water consumption volumes are not monitored, as it is the difference between withdrawal (monitored) and discharge (not monitored in its entirety).

   Hazardous waste disposal may be reduced upstream and downstream through on-site or off-site regeneration of consumable chemicals and through processes that extend the useful life of those chemicals to avoid hazardous waste. We look to reduce hazardous waste in upstream activities by preventing or reducing the amount of hazardous waste generated through extending system life through contaminant removal. Downstream, we look at hazardous waste generated from site operations. We implement several recycling and recovery activities to reduce the need for new chemicals. Hazardous waste is determined from U.S. EPA hazardous manifest or equivalent government shipping documents, with profile waste designations determining the type of waste and Management codes determining the disposal method.
Boeing has dedicated internal teams to prevent waste from going to the landfill. Our reclamation team works to capture and collect materials across the company, while our investment recovery team repurposes materials, facilitates donations and sells scrap materials. Our packaging team assesses opportunities to return or reuse packaging for parts and materials. Packaging engineers have developed standards for reusing containers with our suppliers. Our employees also develop processes to reuse and repurpose incoming packing materials, helping to reduce waste and cost. Generally, third-party vendors handle transport and disposal
of Boeing waste. The company contracts with vendors who provide waste-to- landfill, waste-to-energy, recycling and composting services. Vendors provide disposal data, and in the absence of weight-based data, Boeing calculates weight using a parametric approach.
The Boeing Supplier Code of Conduct, based on the International Forum on Business Ethical Conduct for the Aerospace and Defense Industry’s model code, provides suppliers with a set of responsible business conduct expectations consistent with our policies, principles and ESG efforts.
Boeing supports responsible airplane retirements. We’ve been working for many years to refine our product designs to enable the disassembly of parts and materials recovery. For more information refer to the
Airplane and Carbon Fiber Recycling Fact Sheet.

Our supply chain sustainability approach is aligned to the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct model to effectively address human rights and other ESG risks in our supply chain, through a combination of adopting industry voluntary approaches and Boeing-specific practices.
These include:
Our Supplier Code of Conduct leveraged IFBEC’s model supplier code of conduct to set clear responsible and sustainable practices expectations of our suppliers consistent with an aerospace and defense industry voluntary standard.
We participate in the IAEG Aerospace Industry ESG Engagement (WG11) program. This guides supplier sustainability assessments in a manner efficient for all parties (Boeing and industry suppliers) and enables data-driven insights for stewardship actions.
Our communication predominately occurs through sustainability reporting and regulated disclosures such as modern slavery statements (Boeing UK statement; Boeing Australia statement), our conflict minerals filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Basic Working Conditions and Human Rights statement addressing U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons.

To outline how the standard applies to Boeing and our policies and processes, EHS developed an Occupational Health & Safety Management System (OH&SMS) manual. The OH&SMS manual describes the specific means
used to manage health and safety programs in conformance with OH&SMS requirements. It follows a plan-do-check-act cycle of continual improvement.
    Hazard identification, risk assessment and incident investigation
Employee Safety, Pages 19-20
Work-related hazards are identified through a variety of processes including: scheduled internal Program Reviews, Near-Miss Events and Incidents, EHS Assessments/Audits, employee-identified hazards, Industrial Hygiene Exposure Assessments, Ergonomic Assessments, focused or daily “Area Floor Walks.” Hazards are entered into the company System of Record where the hazard assessment is also documented, along with applied controls (utilizing the hierarchy of controls) to minimize or eliminate the hazard/risk. Action plans for further risk minimization/elimination are also devised, input, and tracked
to completion, as necessary.
Any employee is able and encouraged to report work-related hazards and have several methods to do so, including: reporting through the Enablon system, the Company Speak-Up tool, the Ethics Concern reporting portal, raising the concern to their manager or any manager, or reaching out directly to the site EHS team. The company has an anti-retaliation policy which protects any employee from retaliation for reporting any concerns.
Every employee is encouraged, able, and empowered to stop work and/or
speak up if/when they feel a situation is unsafe. Management/Leadership is also committed to ensuring any employee that stops work due to believing a situation or work area is unsafe, is heard, and the concern addressed prior to activity beginning or resuming. The annual Safety Commitment underscores this as well as consistent discussion around safety as part of every daily stand-up meeting for production activity. Additionally, the “check-in” process is also a method for employees to bring up any concerns.
The Event Management process (BPI-1906) is the Company documented process for work-related incidents and near misses, to ensure proper root cause and corrective action is identified and implemented to prevent recurrence and to ensure risk reduction.

  Worker participation, consultation and communication on occupational health and safety
   Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) participation by employees is a key factor in achieving our OH&S injury prevention objective. Boeing encourages and recognizes employees for participation in such activities as:
Safety Committees: Safety Committees work safety issues, recommend improvements to safety processes, and conduct safety awareness campaigns.
Job Safety Analysis (JSA), Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Development: Job Safety Analyses development occurs using valuable input from employees who know the work best.
Participation in incident investigations: Boeing trains selected employees on incident investigations to take advantage of their experience and expertise to determine root cause and make recommendations for corrective action (e.g., Special Investigation (SI), Incident Review Board (IRB), basic/supervisor led investigations).
Workplace Inspections: Designated employees trained in hazard recognition assist managers and supervisors in conducting inspections of the workplace.
Employee Identification of Hazards: Boeing encourages employees to report identified hazards in Enablon or an equivalent system. Union employees may use the Boeing Safety, Health and Environmental Action Request (SHEAR) process or site equivalent process.
Management of Change process engages employees related to changes in the workplace such as new product development, area layouts, equipment and process changes, etc.
Daily or periodic employee meetings (e.g., “Tier 1” meetings, crew meetings, etc.) — safety is included in daily/periodic meetings.
Employees attend site safety councils, participate in setting OH&S objectives, and assist in the development/implementation of plans. Employee consultation occurs with changes that could introduce new or unfamiliar workplace conditions.

   Boeing employees and persons working on behalf of Boeing are encouraged to raise OH&S issues or concerns at any time via manager, Enablon, Tier 1 meetings, Speak Up portal, the EHS organization, etc., or to the appropriate Boeing person/ organization who can take action.
When appropriate, Boeing consults with employees, union representatives, contractors, and other interested parties concerning OH&S activities or issues that could affect them. They may also consult them to obtain advice on OH&S compliance or improvement ideas. Boeing consults OH&S regulators as necessary to ensure appropriate interpretation of regulatory issues. Boeing uses a cooperative network of regulators and companies to explore emerging issues and share best practices. Discussions with community emergency services groups help ensure a cooperative effort on emergency response situations and awareness of company hazards that could potentially affect the community. Boeing consults with contractors/on-site service providers on OH&S changes that might affect their activities or personnel or when their activities could
affect Boeing personnel.

Employee Safety, Pages 19-20 Key ESG Data, Page 77
Persons performing tasks for or on behalf of the company are competent based on education, experience, and training. Ensuring competency begins with the hiring process. Boeing and external training courses are further resources to ensure employees are competent. Course materials cover general awareness training and competence related training including the importance of conformity with legal requirements, OH&S procedures, and hazards associated with their work, their roles, responsibilities, and the potential consequences of failure to follow work procedures. Numerous training courses include knowledge checks within the material or a quiz at the end. Retraining is required when an employee fails a class, is an action from an incident review, and/or at management discretion. Revisions occur to materials when enterprise policy changes, site policy changes, regulations change; audits require revisions or other reasons, which require a course revision.
The My Learning system tracks and documents all required EHS training managers are responsible for assigning, and tracking their workforce members’ completion of the training for enterprise and site level EHS training and all other trainings relevant to the work being performed. Tools used to accomplish this include using the EHS Training Questionnaire, direct assignments based on skills code.

Workers covered by an occupational health and safety management system
Employee Safety, Pages 19-20
Boeing has a hazard identification process in place that determines the
sources of potential occupational health and safety impacts associated with
our activities, infrastructure, equipment, materials, processes and work organization and defines mitigations to reduce those risks for all employees.
This process takes into account planned or new developments and modifications that may introduce additional risk. Boeing uses multiple mechanisms, tools
and techniques to identify and document hazards in the workplace. These include facility-wide hazard analysis, safety inspections, compliance audits,
site committee tours, employee reporting functions, and job safety analysis,
all of which can be documented in the safety management system of record (Enablon). The ongoing nature of these processes helps ensure that hazards
are continually assessed for changes and adequacy of controls.

   Description of approach to identifying and addressing data security risks in company operations
   RT-AE-230a.2
 We rely extensively on information technology systems and networks to operate our company and meet our business objectives. As cyber threats increase in volume and sophistication, the risk to the security of these systems and networks – and to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data they house – continues to evolve, requiring constant vigilance and concerted, company-wide risk management efforts. Boeing takes a risk-based approach to managing the security of its data and has a documented low risk appetite for cybersecurity and data protection, while recognizing that business requirements may necessitate adjustments to that risk tolerance. To address these risks, we maintain an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight. We also have established a Security Council to strengthen governance and coordination of cyber and physical security activities. While these measures are designed to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized activity, there is no guarantee that they will be sufficient to prevent or mitigate the risk of a cyberattack or data loss or the potentially serious reputational, operational, or financial impacts that may result. A strong partnership exists between IT, Enterprise Security, Corporate Audit, and Legal to ensure identified issues are addressed
in a timely manner and incidents are reported to the appropriate regulatory bodies as required.
  Description of approach to identifying and addressing data security risks in products
RT-AE-230a.2
Product Security Engineering provides a disciplined approach to the development and sustainment of our products which is essential to ensuring mission assurance/resiliency and security. Security is integrated into our engineering processes starting from concept development, ensuring that we develop products that are secure by design. Key cyber attributes and adversity (or threat) to the system are identified during requirements engineering, allocated throughout design, implemented and validated during development, fully tested, and supported during sustainment. Additionally, Boeing works to ensure that our products are designed to anticipate, withstand, recover, and adopt to cyberattack. Specifically, our security processes ensure that we have high-level requirements to baseline and monitor data flow and system behavior, detect anomalies, and actively manage system configuration. The ability of our systems to understand normal operations and rapidly detect and mitigate abnormal combined with the security engineering focus of our development processes, provides Boeing’s programs with a proactive approach to risk management. Product Security is also integrated into the Boeing enterprise Incident Response process, and we work seamlessly with stakeholders to rapidly identify, analyze, and mitigate vulnerabilities and breaches across our portfolio.

  AR, Page 4
We are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors.
The most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take a year or more. As a result of the Russia Ukraine war, we ceased purchasing titanium from Russia. This has not disrupted our operations as we have been able to use inventory on hand and identify alternative sources. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis. We continue to work with a small number of sole-source suppliers to ensure continuity of supply for certain items.
  Business Ethics
 Discussion of processes to manage business ethics risks throughout the value chain
   RT-AE-510a.3
 Boeing strictly forbids bribery and corruption of any kind. It is imperative that we compete on the merits alone. Integrity is a core company value and in support of it, Boeing publishes an internal policy inclusive of anti-corruption and anti-bribery requirements and expectations applicable to employees, board of directors, and other stakeholders. Boeing also provides employees and other stakeholders detailed procedures to ensure compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other global anti-corruption laws and regulations; requires annual training related to ethics and compliance; and provides guidance and instructions on various reporting mechanisms. This guidance is clear that we must never sacrifice our ethical principles to win or keep business—that no business is worth it.
Confidential and anonymous reporting methods are provided. Retaliation against reporting parties is strictly prohibited, and action is taken against violators of anti-retaliation policies. The company also makes its employees aware of their federally protected whistleblower rights, which are designed to protect employees against retaliation for reporting potential wrongdoing by a U.S. contractor or subcontractor.
  Our anti-corruption program is organized into nine risk areas and includes extensive controls. These controls are tested annually through a self-assessment process as well as periodic risk-based corporate audits and external assessments to assess risk, ensure effectiveness, and identify potential enhancement opportunities. Detailed policies and procedures govern each area and demonstrate the company’s zero tolerance for corruption, applicable to employees at all levels and in every location where we operate. We work with our partners, including through Boeing-appointed board members, to ensure that the joint ventures in which we participate adopt similar policies and procedures to govern their respective operation. Program risk is assessed throughout the year, and results are shared at the company’s executive council and board levels. Assessment results are used to make improvements to further strengthen the program and sustain effectiveness.

    Discussion of processes to manage business ethics risks throughout the value chain
   RT-AE-510a.3
 The nine risk areas are:
1. Business Courtesies, Offering and Accepting
Boeing employees are required to be vigilant in ensuring that any business courtesy is reasonable, lawful and fully justified under the circumstances, and does not suggest the appearance of impropriety. Company policies and procedures strictly prohibit offering any courtesy that could be misinterpreted as an attempt to gain an improper business advantage, and include elevating thresholds of management approval. Before any courtesy is offered, an employee must determine that it is lawful and appropriate and would not cause embarrassment to the company or recipient. Additionally, employees must follow strict guidelines when determining if an offered courtesy can be accepted. Employees are prohibited from soliciting courtesies, or accepting any courtesies when a real or perceived attempt is being made to influence action by Boeing.
2. Employment Decisions
Boeing policies and procedures require that all hiring decisions be made fairly, ethically and in accordance with all relevant laws and regulations. Additional precautions, including Law Department review, are taken for hiring decisions involving current or former non-U.S. government officials, representatives of non-U.S. airlines, officials of public international organizations and their relatives.
3. Financial Controls and Books and Records
The Boeing financial management system is designed to assure, among other things, that company resources are effectively and efficiently managed and that reporting requirements are satisfied with integrity and reliability and in compliance with all relevant laws, regulations and generally accepted practices and principles. Specific to anti-corruption controls, all employees are required to maintain accurate financial records and appropriately document and obtain approval of costs and expenses. Employees may not approve expense reports for themselves or their peers. Use of company credit cards for non-business expenses is strictly prohibited. Personal credit cards may not be used for business expenses, except in very limited circumstances. Company policy prohibits falsification of accounting or other business records.
4. Grants, Business Donations, Sponsorships, Memberships
Boeing makes investments in communities where employees live and work through charitable grants, in-kind donations, sponsorships, volunteer time, and memberships to various organizations to promote positive and sustainable change. Boeing policy requires that all grants, business donations, sponsorships, and memberships be evaluated for alignment with company values and ethical standards. All requests for payments or donations to support an organization or project outside of the United States are reviewed by the Law Department. Company contributions are subject to review and approval prior to offering, as outlined in the company’s internal Company Contributions procedure. This addresses our internal contribution process inclusive of, but not limited to, the application process and properly vetting recipients for charitable donations, sponsorships, and more. At Boeing, we also maintain and monitor a Conflicts of Interest program, which requires each of us to demonstrate accountability and openness by disclosing relationships, outside activities, and financial interests that may pose a conflict of interest or affect our objectivity. Preventing or mitigating conflicts of interest is critical to operating with integrity and maintaining the trust of our partners, customers and stakeholders.

  5. International Consultants
Boeing recognizes that good business practices include drawing on the expertise of outside consultants and professional service providers. To ensure those relationships comply with applicable laws, the company has detailed requirements for creating, maintaining and renewing international consultant relationships. The company conducts appropriate and risk-based due diligence based on the international consultant’s statement of work, which may include geographic location, ownership, and other relevant information. The company renews that due diligence at appropriate intervals. International consultant agreements require strict compliance with applicable laws, including anti-corruption laws, and with Boeing’s ethical business conduct guidelines. Hiring, renewing or expanding the scope of work of an international consultant requires multi-layer executive management approvals and review by the Law Department.
6. Mergers and Acquisitions
Boeing pursues mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and equity investments when such transactions align with the company’s strategic and operating objectives. All such transactions are accompanied by comprehensive due diligence to examine rigorously the books, records, corporate filings, operations and compliance history of the candidates for the transactions.
7. Non-Sales Agreements (including Teaming Agreements)
Boeing policy sets out detailed procedures for review and approval of teaming agreements and other non-sales agreements with companies, including appropriate levels of due diligence to ensure compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable anti- corruption laws. Terms and conditions in those agreements must include warranties of compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws.
8. Non-U.S. Political Contributions
Boeing maintains detailed requirements for all political activities inside and outside the United States. For activities outside the United States, Boeing policy prohibits company contributions to political candidates, political parties and party officials, and political advocacy groups. This prohibition covers both monetary contributions and in-kind donations.
9. Supplier Relationships and Anti-Kickback Compliance
Across our supply chain we are united by a shared commitment to the Boeing values. Appropriate due diligence is conducted for potential suppliers, such as screening governmental and industry listings for instances of sanctions and/or other compliance concerns. The terms and conditions in all supplier agreements require that suppliers provide assurance of compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, granting Boeing contractual rights in the event of a breach, inclusive of termination rights. Additionally, company procedures prohibit employees from soliciting gifts from suppliers or having any contact with suppliers that would give rise to even the appearance of impropriety, and require all employees to comply with anti-kickback laws and regulations.
Additional resources regarding our shared responsibility with suppliers and Boeing’s anti-corruption compliance program are: Supplier Principles; Ethical Business Conduct Guidelines; Anti-Corruption Program.

with 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For 2024, we agreed to buy 9.4 million gallons (35.6 million liters) of blended SAF to support our commercial operations, more than a 60% increase from 2023.
In May 2023, Boeing joined together with Equatic, an ocean-based carbon removal company, to support permanent carbon dioxide removal and green hydrogen production.
Boeing increased renewable electricity by 16% in 2023, which translates to 39% renewable electricity across the enterprise through direct purchases and renewable energy credits.
Boeing supported the launch of the Aerospace Manufacturing Technology program at Nunez Community College in Louisiana. This is the only program dedicated to aerospace manufacturing technicians in the state, and it is local to the Artemis project collaboration between Boeing and NASA at the nearby Michoud Facility.
Boeing and its employees donated $191 million and contributed 477,000 volunteer hours to 13,784 community partners in 2023 to help build better communities worldwide.
Boeing contracts with approximately 11,000 suppliers globally. In 2023, we spent nearly $5.4 billion with diverse suppliers and small businesses.
In May, Boeing released the Boeing Cascade Climate Impact Model for public use. The tool will help inform the most impactful and effective strategies for aviation to reach its sustainability targets.
In 2023, a Wisk-led collaboration of aviation leaders — including Boeing, Insitu Pacific, the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority, and Airways New Zealand, successfully completed a first-of-its-kind flight trial integrating an uncrewed aircraft into controlled airspace.
Boeing, NASA, and United Airlines partnered for in-flight testing to measure how sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) affects contrails and non-carbon emissions.
For the third year in a row, we saw exit rates for women, men and teammates of all races all within a point of each other. Our 2025 Aspiration is to “achieve parity in retention rates of all groups,” and we have been pleased to see our resignation rates are at parity across genders and U.S. racial/ethnic identities.
As of January 2024, 3,800 teammates from around the world registered to be Inclusion Ambassadors, committed to advancing inclusion on their own teams. These inclusion ambassadors bolster self-ID participation, facilitate team discussions to promote inclusion, and share best practices that can scale across business units and regions.
Boeing Aerostructures Australia released its first Reflect Reconciliation Action Plan, which seeks to build trustful and respectful relationships with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Peoples. It aligns with our commitment to the core values of inclusion, respect and diversity, and acts as a roadmap for the company’s inner and outer evolution toward reconciliation.

2023 Progress
Boeing set a 2030 goal to reduce GHG emissions by 55% for Scope 1 and Scope 2. In 2023 we achieved 26% absolute reduction at year-end 2023 from 2017 base year toward our 2030 goal (Scope 1 and Scope 2).
Employees across the globe took more than 1 million 60-second actions for the environment for Earth Day on April 22 to May 31 in 2023.
Boeing looks at every stage of the product life cycle through a sustainability lens, from design through to how materials are recycled after an aircraft is retired. 90% of the parts and materials in Boeing aircraft can be reused and recycled across aerospace and other industries.
The U.S. Air Force designated the Sustainable Flight Demonstrator (SFD) as the newest X-plane; this is the first X-plane specifically focused on helping achieve its goal of net-zero aviation greenhouse gas emissions.
Boeing has prepared a charitable grants package to support nonprofit organizations across Southeast Asia in 2024. These grants will improve access to clean water, promote sustainable livelihoods in agroforestry, animal and forest conservation, address key health and hygiene initiatives, advance STEM-related programs, and support at-risk communities.
Boeing supports the commercial aviation industry’s ambition to be net zero by 2050 by working with decision-makers and policy institutions globally. Using the Boeing Cascade Climate Impact Model will help inform impactful and effective strategies for aviation to reach its sustainability targets.
Boeing opened its first Research & Technology Center in Nagoya, Japan. The new center will be focused on producing lightweight composites at higher rate with less environmental impact; finding novel ways to recycle composite material; advancing commercial airplane compatibility with 100% SAF; and exploring the feasibility of integrating hydrogen fuel cell systems into an airplane.
Boeing collaborated with the FAA and U.S. Department of Transportation to catalyze the development and use of SAF among APEC member countries. The initiative will support identifying the availability of sustainable feedstock, analyzing new pathways to optimize SAF production, leveraging existing industries and infrastructure for SAF production, enabling the development of policies for production and use, and exploring accounting mechanisms.
Boeing has partnered with over 40 organizations and invested over $22 million since 2006 to support systemic improvements in education, economic empowerment and the alleviation of poverty in Africa. Together with governments and non-governmental organizations Boeing has been rolling out STEM for Sustainability programs on the African continent, namely in Egypt and Morocco. Now Boeing and JA Africa are embarking on the first sustainability and social equity program in sub-Saharan Africa.
