# Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition

(Tables present dollars in millions, except per-share data) 

General 

Management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is intended to assist the reader in understanding and assessing significant changes and trends related to our results of operations and financial position. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Certain statements in this Item 7 constitute forward-looking statements. Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in "Forward-Looking Statements" and Item 1A, "Risk Factors," may cause our actual results, financial position, and cash generated from operations to differ from these forward-looking statements. 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 

This section provides an overview of our financial results, our clinical development pipeline, and other matters affecting our company and industry. 

Financial Results 

The following table summarizes certain financial information: 

Percent Change 2024 2023 Revenue $ 45,042.7   $ 34,124.1 32 Net income 10,590.0   5,240.4 102 Earnings per share - diluted 11.71   5.80 102 
Revenue increased in 2024 driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices. The increase in revenue in 2024 was primarily driven by Mounjaro, Zepbound, and Verzenio, partially offset by Trulicity. 

Net income and earnings per share increased in 2024, primarily due to higher gross margin, partially offset by increased research and development expenses, marketing, selling, and administrative expenses, and asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges. 

See "Results of Operations" for additional information. 

Clinical Development Pipeline 

Our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire, develop, and commercialize innovative medicines. We currently have approximately 55 new medicine candidates in clinical development or under regulatory review, and a larger number of projects in the discovery phase. 

The following select new molecular entities (NMEs) and new indication line extension (NILEX) products are currently in Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials or have been submitted for regulatory review or have recently received regulatory approval in the United States (U.S.), European Union (EU), or Japan. The table reflects the status of these NMEs and NILEX products, including certain other developments, up to the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:

There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development, the introduction of new products and indications, business development activities to enhance or refine our product pipeline, and commercialization of our products. There is a high rate of failure inherent in drug discovery and development. To bring a product from the discovery phase to market takes considerable time and entails significant cost. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain; we may not succeed in developing, licensing, or acquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products that have lost or will lose intellectual property protection or are displaced by competing products or therapies," for additional information. 

We manage research and development spending across our portfolio of potential new medicines and indications. A delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. Due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process, we cannot reliably estimate the nature, timing, and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects, nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from any successful research and development project. Each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline, and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense. While we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes, we must make significant cost estimations and allocations, some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. Therefore, we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project, by pre-clinical versus clinical spend, or by therapeutic category. 

Other Matters 

Patent Matters 

We depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenue, cash flows, and earnings. 

See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of legal proceedings currently pending regarding certain of our patents. 

See Item 1, "Business—Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights," for a discussion of the impacts of trends involving intellectual property on our business and results. 

Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access and Certain Other Regulatory Developments 

Reforms, including those that may stem from political initiatives, periods of uneven economic growth or downturns, or as a result of inflation or deflation, the emergence or escalation of, and responses to, international tension and conflicts, or government budgeting priorities, are expected to continue to result in added pressure on pricing and reimbursement for our products. 

Global concern over access to, and affordability of, pharmaceutical products continues to drive regulatory and legislative debate and action, as well as cost containment efforts by governmental authorities. Such measures include the use of mandated discounts, price reporting requirements, mandated reference prices, restrictive formularies, changes to available intellectual property protections, as well as other efforts. In 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Among other measures, the IRA requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to effectively set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. Generally, these government prices apply beginning at nine years (for medicines approved under a New Drug Application) or thirteen years (for medicines approved under a Biologics License Application) following FDA approval or licensure for the molecule and are set at a price that generally represents a significant discount from existing prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. While the law specifies a maximum price that HHS can set, it does not set a minimum price. The Medicare price HHS determines may impact the product's best price determination under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Drug Pricing Program, potentially leading to a negative impact on both Medicaid and 340B prices. In August 2023, HHS selected Jardiance, which is part of our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as one of the first ten medicines subject to government-set prices effective in 2026. In August 2024, HHS announced the government-set prices for these medicines with Jardiance subject to a 66% discount compared to the 2023 U.S. calendar year list price for a 30-day supply and discounts for the other nine medicines ranging from approximately 38% to 79% below list price. Given our product portfolio, we expect additional significant products will be selected in future years, which would have the effect of accelerating revenue erosion prior to expiry of exclusivities. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products could significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations. 

Other IRA provisions require drug manufacturers to provide rebates for Medicare Part B and Part D medicines under certain circumstances. Also, on January 1, 2025, the Part D benefit redesign replaced the Part D Coverage Gap Discount Program with a new manufacturer discount program. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties, which could be significant. 

The IRA has, and will continue to, meaningfully influence our business strategies and those of our competitors. In particular, the nine-year timeline to set prices for medicines approved under a New Drug Application reduces the attractiveness of investment in small molecule innovation. The IRA can cause changes to development approach and timing and investments at-risk. The full impact of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry, including the implications to us of a competitor's product being selected for price setting, remains uncertain. 

Additional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including those proposed or pursued by lawmakers, regulators, and other authorities in the U.S. and worldwide, could adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. For example, the U.S. House of Representatives recently passed the BIOSECURE Act, which is under consideration in the U.S. Senate. This legislation, if passed, could affect elements of the pharmaceutical supply chain; although as currently drafted we do not anticipate the bill would have a material impact on our business. 

Consolidation and integration of private payers and pharmacy benefit managers in the U.S. has also significantly impacted the market for pharmaceuticals by increasing payer leverage in negotiating manufacturer price or rebate concessions and pharmacy reimbursement rates. Furthermore, restrictive or unfavorable pricing, coverage, or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments, regulatory agencies, courts, or private payers may adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. We expect that these actions may intensify and could particularly affect certain products, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, we are engaged in litigation and investigations related to the 340B program, access to insulin, pricing, product safety, and other matters that, if resolved adversely to us, could negatively impact our business and consolidated results of operations. It is not currently possible to predict the overall potential adverse impact to us or the general pharmaceutical industry of continued cost containment efforts worldwide. 

In addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, quality assurance, safety signals, evolving standards, and increased scrutiny around excipients and potential impurities such as nitrosamines, and similar regulations and standards (and comparable foreign regulations and standards) for our products in some cases lead to regulatory and legal actions, product recalls and seizures, fines and penalties, interruption of production leading to product shortages, import bans or denials of import certifications, inability to realize the benefit of capital expenditures, or delays or denials in new product approvals, line extensions or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of the issues, or other negative impacts, any of which result in reputational harm or adversely affect our business. 

See Item 1, "Business—Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access," Item 1A, "Risk Factors," and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

Incretin Medicines 

At various times during 2024, demand for our incretin medicines exceeded production. Supply and channel dynamics have also contributed to variability in quarter-over-quarter revenue growth rates for tirzepatide. Tirzepatide supply currently exceeds demand in the U.S. Demand in launched markets remains dynamic, and increases or changes in demand, by dose or overall, as well as the complex supply chain, may result in periodic unavailability of certain presentations and dose levels at certain locations even when total tirzepatide supply can meet demand. Supply considerations will continue to influence the timing and approach (including available presentations) of tirzepatide launches in new markets. We continue to expand manufacturing capacity and progress efforts to bring tirzepatide to patients via different delivery presentations, such as single-use vials and multi-use pens. Production increases will continue, and additional capacity is expected to be operational over the next several years. 

We have seen an increase in the production, marketing, and sale of counterfeit, misbranded, adulterated, and compounded incretins. These practices may impact patient safety and undermine regulatory drug approval processes. Lilly will continue to consider all options, including filing lawsuits where appropriate, to address unlawful practices and the patient safety risks of unapproved, untested, and manipulated drugs. 

See Item 1, "Business—Government Regulation of Our Operations and Products” and Item 1A, "Risk —Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We and our products face intense competition, including from multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and lower-cost generic and biosimilar manufacturers, and such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business," for additional information. 

Tax Matters 

We are subject to income taxes and various other taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions; therefore, changes in both domestic and international tax laws or regulations have affected and may affect our effective tax rate, results of operations, and cash flows. The U.S. and countries around the world are actively proposing and enacting tax law changes. Further, actions taken with respect to tax-related matters by associations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the European Commission could influence tax laws in countries in which we operate. Tax authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business routinely examine our tax returns and are expected to increase their scrutiny of cross-border tax issues. Changes to existing U.S. and foreign tax laws and increased scrutiny by tax authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions could have a material adverse impact our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows. 

Effective January 1, 2024, several EU and non-EU countries enacted legislation (known as "Pillar Two") that provided for a minimum level of taxation of multinational companies. The increase to income tax expense as a result of the global minimum tax was not material in 2024 and is not expected to be material in current and future years. Our assessment of the impact for 2025 and subsequent years could be affected by legislative guidance and future enactment of additional provisions. 

Acquisitions 

We invest in external research and technologies and manufacturing capabilities that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts. These investments can take many forms, including acquisitions, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements. We view our business development activity as a way to enhance or refine our pipeline and strengthen our business. 

See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our recent acquisitions. 

Continued regulatory focus on business combinations in our industry, including by the Federal Trade Commission and competition authorities in Europe and other jurisdictions, could continue to delay, jeopardize, or increase the costs of our business development activities and may negatively impact our consolidated financial position or results of operations. For discussion of risks related to business development activities, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain; we may not succeed in developing, licensing, or acquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products that have lost or will lose intellectual property protection or are displaced by competing products or therapies." 

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates 

As a global company, we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan. While we seek to manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques, significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a material impact, either positive or negative, on our consolidated results of operations in any given period. There is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in these rates have and could adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. 

Other Factors 

Other factors have had, and may continue to have, an impact on our consolidated results of operations. These factors include cost and wage inflation, supply chain and labor market complexities, international tension and conflicts, uneven economic growth or downturns or uncertainty, and an increase in overall demand in our industry for certain products and materials. 

See Item 1A, "Risk Factors," for additional information on risk factors that could impact our business and operations.

(4) Zyprexa revenue includes sale of the rights for the olanzapine portfolio in 2023. 

Revenue of Mounjaro increased 85 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by strong demand and increased supply. Revenue outside of the U.S. was $2.59 billion in 2024 compared to $328.9 million in 2023, primarily driven by volume growth in launched markets. 

Revenue of Verzenio increased 36 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand, wholesaler buying patterns and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 39 percent, driven by increased demand. 

Revenue of Trulicity decreased 32 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased volume primarily due to competitive dynamics and supply constraints during the first half of 2024. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 8 percent, driven by decreased volume primarily due to competitive dynamics and actions we have taken to manage demand. 

Revenue of Zepbound in the U.S. in 2024 was $4.93 billion, compared to $175.8 million in 2023. Zepbound launched in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with obesity or overweight with weight-related comorbidities in November 2023. 

Revenue of Jardiance remained relatively flat in the U.S. as increased demand was offset by lower realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 52 percent, driven by increased volume and a one-time payment received of $300.0 million associated with an amendment to our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim. Pursuant to the amendment, we and Boehringer Ingelheim adjusted commercialization responsibilities for Jardiance within certain smaller markets. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim involving Jardiance. 

Revenue of Taltz increased 18 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices due to changes in estimates for rebates and discounts, as well as increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 19 percent, primarily driven by increased demand. 

Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses 

The following table summarizes our gross margin, costs, and expenses: 

Percent Change 2024 2023 Gross margin $ 36,624.4   $ 27,041.9 35 Gross margin as a percent of revenue 81.3   % 79.2 % Research and development $ 10,990.6   $ 9,313.4 18 Marketing, selling, and administrative 8,593.8   7,403.1 16

NM - not meaningful 

Gross margin as a percent of revenue in 2024 increased 2.1 percentage points compared with 2023, primarily driven by favorable product mix and higher realized prices. 

Research and development expenses increased 18 percent in 2024, primarily driven by continued investments in our early and late-stage portfolio. 

Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 16 percent in 2024, primarily driven by promotional efforts supporting ongoing and future launches. 

Acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges recognized in 2024 primarily related to the acquisition of Morphic. Acquired IPR&D charges recognized in 2023 primarily related to acquisitions of DICE Therapeutics, Inc., Versanis Bio, Inc., Emergence Therapeutics AG, and Mablink Biosciences SAS and from a business development transaction with Beam Therapeutics Inc. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

Asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges recognized in 2024 primarily related to a $435.0 million litigation charge and an intangible asset impairment for Vitrakvi, driven by expected commercial projections. See Notes 5 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

Our effective tax rate was 16.5 percent in 2024, compared with an effective tax rate of 20.1 percent in 2023. The effective tax rates for 2024 and 2023 were both unfavorably impacted by non-deductible acquired IPR&D charges, with a larger impact occurring in 2023. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

For additional information for other–net, (income) expense, see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. 

Operating Results—2023 

For a discussion of our results of operations pertaining to 2023 and 2022 see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 

We believe our available cash and cash equivalents, together with our ability to generate operating cash flow and our access to short-term and long-term borrowings, are sufficient to fund our existing and planned capital requirements, which include: 

• working capital requirements, including related to employee payroll and benefits, clinical trials, manufacturing materials, and taxes; 

• capital expenditures; 

• share repurchases and dividends; 

• repayment of outstanding short-term and long-term borrowings; 

• milestone and royalty payments; 

• potential business development activities, including acquisitions, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements; and 

• contributions to our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. 

Our management continuously evaluates our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our capital requirements. As of December 31, 2024, our material cash requirements primarily related to purchases of goods and services to produce our products and conduct our operations, income tax payments, capital expenditures, dividends, milestone and royalty payments, business development activities, share repurchases and repayment of outstanding borrowings (see Notes 14, 4, 3, 13, and 11 to the consolidated financial statements). We anticipate our cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services will be consistent with our past levels relative to revenues. 

Capital expenditures were $5.06 billion during 2024, compared to $3.45 billion in 2023. We are making investments in global facilities to manufacture existing and future products. These investments, and other capital investments that support our operations, have increased our capital expenditures and will result in meaningfully higher capital expenditures over the next several years. 

As we expand our manufacturing capacity in order to meet existing and expected demand of our medicines, we have entered, and expect to continue to enter, into various agreements for contract manufacturing and for supply of materials. The executed agreements could, under certain circumstances, require us to pay up to approximately $14 billion if we do not purchase specified amounts of goods or services primarily related to our incretin medicines, including medicines in development, over the durations of the agreements, which are generally up to 8 years. 

Cash and cash equivalents increased to $3.27 billion as of December 31, 2024, compared with $2.82 billion at December 31, 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $8.82 billion in 2024, compared with $4.24 billion in 2023. Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional information on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. 

In addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we held total investments of $3.37 billion and $3.16 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

We paid $3.35 billion in 2024 for acquired IPR&D primarily related to the acquisition of Morphic. We paid $947.7 million in 2024 primarily related to the acquisition of a manufacturing site in Wisconsin. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

As of December 31, 2024, total debt was $33.64 billion, an increase of $8.42 billion compared with $25.23 billion at December 31, 2023. In February 2025, we issued $6.5 billion of fixed-rate notes. We expect to use the net cash proceeds from the offering to fund potential business development activities, as well as general business purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

As of December 31, 2024, we had a total of $8.45 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $8.00 billion of which is available to support our commercial paper program. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short-term borrowing needs. 

Dividends of $5.20 per share and $4.52 per share were paid in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The quarterly dividend was increased to $1.50 per share effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2025, resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2025 of $6.00 per share. 

In 2024, we repurchased $2.50 billion of shares, which completed our $5.00 billion share repurchase program that our board authorized in May 2021. Our board authorized a $15.00 billion share repurchase program in December 2024. No shares were repurchased under this new program as of December 31, 2024. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

See "—Executive Overview—Other Matters—Patent Matters" for information regarding losses of patent protection. 

Both domestically and abroad, we monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment and international tension and conflicts; the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers, including foreign government-backed agencies and suppliers; the uncertain impact of healthcare legislation; and various international government funding levels. 

In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, currency values, and fair values of equity securities. These fluctuations impact the costs of financing, investing, and operating our business. We seek to address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of this risk management program is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading. 

Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and in some cases we enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. As of December 31, 2024, all of our total long-term debt is at a fixed rate. We have converted approximately 5 percent of our long-term fixed-rate notes to floating rates through the use of interest rate swaps. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2024 and 2023, including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period. 

Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan. We face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We in some cases enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (primarily the euro, Chinese yuan, and Japanese yen). Our corporate risk-management policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities. We periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates. A hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or financial position over a one-year period. This sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions. 

Our fair value risk exposure relates primarily to our public equity investments and to our equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our carrying values of these investments were $1.35 billion and $1.32 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20 percent change in fair value of the equity instruments would have impacted other-net, (income) expense by $269.9 million and $263.9 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third-party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. 

Individually, these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our results of operations or cash flows, respectively, in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. These arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives. We view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products. 

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

In preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below. 

Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount Accruals 

Background and Uncertainties 

We recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts, product sales to customers (net product revenue) and collaborations and other arrangements. For product sales to customers, provisions for returns, rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. To determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts include rebates associated with sales covered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, and chargeback programs, as well as reductions in revenue related to our patient assistance programs, in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs, as well as patient assistance program costs, by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an evaluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold via these programs, and our product pricing. Although we accrue a liability for revenue reductions related to these programs at the time we record the sale, the reduction related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our net product revenue may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods. 

Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on revenue recognition and sales return, rebate, and discount accruals. 

Revenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements includes our share of profits from the collaborations, as well as royalties, upfront and milestone payments we receive under these types of contracts. 

Financial Statement Impact 

We believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Our rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2024, a 5 percent change in our consolidated sales return, rebate, and discount liability would result in a change in revenue of approximately $600 million. 

The portion of our consolidated sales return, rebate, and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the U.S. was approximately 90 percent as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. 

The following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. sales return, rebate, and discount liability balances, including managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, chargeback, and patient assistance programs: 

2024 2023 Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, beginning of year $ 10,667.5   $ 8,214.1 Reduction of net sales (1) 

41,452.3   37,866.8 Cash payments (41,807.0) (35,413.4) Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, end of year $ 10,312.8   $ 10,667.5 
(1) Adjustments of the estimates for these returns, rebates, and discounts to actual results were less than 2 percent of consolidated revenue for each of the years presented. 

Litigation Liabilities and Other Contingencies 

Background and Uncertainties 

Litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past matters, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, as applicable, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. 

We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial condition of the insurers, and the possibility of and length of time for collection. Due to a very restrictive market for liability insurance, we are predominantly self-insured for liability losses for all our currently and previously marketed products, as well as for litigation or investigations related to our pricing practices or other similar matters. In addition to insurance coverage, we consider any third-party indemnification to which we are entitled or under which we are obligated. With respect to our third-party indemnification rights, these considerations include the nature of the indemnification, the financial condition of the indemnifying party, and the possibility of and length of time for collection. 

The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables are reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. 

Acquisitions 

Background and Uncertainties 

To determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition, we make certain judgments, which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities and assets would meet the definition of a business under the relevant accounting rules. 

If the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair values on our consolidated balance sheet as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, is recorded as goodwill. If the acquired set of activities and assets does not meet the definition of a business, the transaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and, therefore, any acquired IPR&D that does not have an alternative future use is charged to acquired IPR&D on our consolidated statement of operations at the acquisition date, and goodwill is not recorded. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

The judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as estimated asset lives, can materially affect our consolidated results of operations. The fair values of intangible assets, including acquired IPR&D, are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Significant estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, probability of technical success, revenue projections, and discount rate. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities. 

The fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using the "income method," as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. 

The fair value of any contingent consideration liability that results from a business combination is primarily determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, as described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Estimating the fair value of contingent consideration requires the use of significant estimates and judgments, including, but not limited to, probability of technical success, timing of the potential milestone event, and the discount rate. 

Financial Statement Impact 

As of December 31, 2024, a 5 percent change in the contingent consideration liabilities would result in a change in income before income taxes of $1.6 million. 

Impairment of Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived Assets 

Background and Uncertainties 

We review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset (or asset group) to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset's net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted. 

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value is performed to determine the amount of any impairment. 

Several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of long-lived assets, all of which require multiple assumptions. When determining the fair value of indefinite-lived acquired IPR&D as well as the fair value of finite-lived intangible assets for impairment testing purposes, we utilize the "income method," as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. 

For acquired IPR&D assets, the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product, as discussed previously in "—Executive Overview—Clinical Development Pipeline." The nature of the pharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to maintain a successful portfolio of approved products. As such, it is likely that some acquired IPR&D assets will become impaired in the future. 

Estimates of future cash flows, based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management's judgment. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 

Income Taxes 

Background and Uncertainties 

We file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record estimates in our financial statements based upon these interpretations at the applicable tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax returns are routinely subject to examination by taxing authorities, which could result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments. Inherent uncertainties also exist in estimates of many tax positions due to the complexity of tax laws. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances such as changes to existing tax law, the issuance of regulations by taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of a tax examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are both appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns; however, given the uncertainty of positions that could be taken by taxing authorities during the examinations of our tax returns, the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in liabilities that are greater than amounts accrued. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. 

We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses, tax credits, and other tax carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions, when the amount of future taxable income is unlikely to support their utilization. 

Financial Statement Impact 

As of December 31, 2024, a 5 percent change in the amount of uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of $131.3 million and $48.2 million, respectively. 

Retirement Benefits Assumptions 

Background and Uncertainties 

Defined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, and retirement age. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits. 

Annually, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. We use an actuarially determined, plan-specific yield curve of high quality, fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates. In evaluating the expected return on plan assets, we consider many factors, with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions, asset returns and asset allocations (approximately 75 percent of which are growth investments), and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results, as well as the discount rates and expected return on plan assets of other companies, where applicable. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages. 

Financial Statement Impact 

If the 2024 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $15.0 million. If the 2024 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $33.2 million. If our assumption regarding the 2024 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by $35.9 million. The U.S. plans, including Puerto Rico, represent approximately 80 percent for total projected benefit obligation and 85 percent for total plan assets at December 31, 2024.
