Management Approach
Lilly acknowledges that climate change is negatively impacting human and environmental health. Action against climate change is required to achieve the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement and to avoid the most detrimental effects of climate change by limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 °C. Lilly is taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within our operations and along our value chain. We have assessed our Scope 3 emissions and progressed in our journey to identify climate related risks and opportunities in our business.
As a global medicine company, we recognize our responsibility to reduce our carbon footprint and manage climate-related risks and opportunities to do our part. Lilly supports the Paris Climate Agreement, discloses information according to recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and strives to implement these recommendations across the TCFD categories of Governance, Strategy, Risk Management and Metrics & Targets. For more information, see our TCFD Metrics.
As Lilly continues to expand its global presence and innovate in the pharmaceutical sector, we recognize the importance of aligning growth with our sustainability goals. Our projected growth trajectory entails careful consideration of its impact on our carbon footprint, resource consumption and waste generation. At Lilly, we are committed to implementing a range of initiatives to advance environmental sustainability across our operations and value chain. This includes initiatives to enhance energy efficiency across our operations and investments in renewable energy sources to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and decrease greenhouse
gas emissions. These efforts are aimed at reducing environmental impacts while fostering sustainable business growth.
Climate Action Strategy
To mitigate the impact of Lilly’s business operations on the environment and achieve our 2030 goals, described below, we are applying a three-pronged approach:
1. Reducing our energy and emissions by making our overall operations more efficient
2. Replacing carbon-intensive processes and energy sources with low-carbon alternatives
3. Offsetting remaining emissions and energy sources that could not be reduced or replaced, by purchasing emissions offsets from high-quality, third-party verified carbon reduction projects (note: it is not currently possible to eliminate all emissions sources or transition all direct energy supplies to renewable sources).
See our CDP Climate Response for more information regarding our governance and approach to climate change and related risks and opportunities.

2030 Climate Goals and
Our Progress to Date
Lilly is committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, and prioritizing energy efficiency to become a more climate-resilient organization. We have set climate goals for 2030 as we work toward contributing to a low- carbon economy:
Secure 100% of our electricity from renewable sources
Through the end of 2024, 58% of our electricity demand – 399,000 MWh – came from renewable sources.
We are focusing our efforts on securing renewable electricity using a three-pronged approach:
• On-Site Generation - The first, and most effective effort, is implementing direct renewable electricity through on-site solar installation. We have established on-site solar arrays at our sites in the United States, France, Ireland, India, Italy, Spain, China and Puerto Rico. We aim to expand our use of on-site solar generation where possible at existing sites and implement on site solar arrays at our new manufacturing sites as we expand our footprint to support business growth.
• Purchased Renewable Electricity - We are actively purchasing renewable energy from our utility providers across numerous sites globally.
• Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) - We also purchase renewable energy certificates (RECs)
that support clean energy generation in certain regions where we operate. Our REC purchases align with globally recognized standards, such as the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol guidelines, ensuring credibility and regional environmental benefits.
Become carbon neutral in our own operations (Scope 1 and 2 emissions)
Lilly strives to be carbon neutral in our own operations by 2030, and we are working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions throughout our operations. Our strategy is
to first reduce emissions as much as possible internally before we consider offsets to cover the remaining emissions. From 2020 to 2024, we achieved a 37% absolute emissions reduction in our own operations and 15% year-on-year reduction from 2023 to 2024. This reduction was driven by energy efficiency improvements and increased use of our renewable electricity, which was partially offset by business growth at existing sites and the startup of new manufacturing facilities.

 Reducing Energy
and Emissions
In 2024, our energy consumption increased compared to 2023 due to the start-up of new Lilly manufacturing facilities and increased manufacturing production
at existing sites. Although our energy consumption increased, we were able to reduce our carbon
emissions by transitioning to cleaner and more efficient technologies that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with this energy. We continue to emphasize energy efficiency at our facilities, including:
• Utilizing Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) principles as a framework for healthy, efficient and more sustainable buildings in new and updated facilities, facilitating the use of advanced energy monitoring and control solutions, conducting energy assessments, and evaluating and incorporating alternative energy sources.
• Participating in local, regional and national forums to understand and integrate energy management best practices, and to support responsible
and cost-effective decision-making and policy development. Examples of participation include the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s ENERGY STAR Pharmaceutical Focus Group,
the Association of Energy Engineers, and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers.
• Providing an Energy, Waste and Water Reduction Fund which provides capital funding to encourage projects that demonstrate the greatest potential for reduction in energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, waste generation or water consumption. Projects supported by this fund have led to meaningful energy efficiency improvements and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions each year.
• Actively recognizing innovation and excellence
in Health, Safety and the Environment (HSE) management by granting annual HSE awards. Nominations represent a significant accomplishment, and the awards recognize our employees for helping Lilly achieve energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals and other HSE improvements. Projects are also assessed on their potential to scale in other areas across the company.
Reducing Emissions through
Cleaner Energy
We continue to evaluate how to improve our energy resiliency and expand our use of renewable electricity consistent with our goal to diversify our energy sources and decrease our greenhouse gas emissions over time.
Enhancing the Use of Renewables
In 2024, 58% of our electricity was secured from renewable sources, doubling our renewable electricity compared to 2023. We have reduced greenhouse gas emissions at key facilities by leveraging on-site solar generation. See locations and examples below.
Lilly signed a renewable power purchase agreement to procure approximately 450,000 megawatt hours per year of renewable electricity from a newly constructed wind farm. We anticipate the new wind farm will be online in 2025. This is expected to provide a significant portion of Lilly’s renewable electricity needs as we expand our manufacturing footprint to meet the global demands for our medicines while progressing toward our goal of achieving 100% renewable electricity by 2030.

Energy Resiliency
Energy resiliency is about ensuring our facilities have a reliable supply of energy and contingency measures in place in the event of a power failure.
Combined heat and power systems provide energy resilience by supplying electricity and thermal energy to facilities on a continuous basis with the ability to operate independently from the grid. This reduces the risks associated with energy supply disruptions or climate-related events.
Fleet Fuel Economy
Our GREENDirections program, which applies to
Lilly’s sales and marketing affiliates around the world, focuses on carbon emissions reduction, office energy conservation and waste reduction. Each year, our affiliates maintain a current roadmap to deliver on these priorities and look for opportunities to enhance their environmental performance.
Lilly affiliates have demonstrated a commitment to reducing carbon emissions by setting ambitious goals and have begun fleet transitions to electric vehicles (EVs). In geographies where EVs and infrastructure are not readily available, affiliates will continue offering fleet vehicles with more efficient fuel economy (e.g., hybrids and plug-in hybrids) and emphasizing sustainable driving and work practices in training programs.
Scope 3 Emissions and
Supply Chain Engagement
The Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard classifies Scope 3 emissions as indirect greenhouse
gas emissions (not included in Scope 2) that occur in
an organization’s value chain. There are 15 categories
in Scope 3 divided into upstream emissions (activities related to manufacturing of our products) and downstream emissions (activities related to distribution and use of our products). The emissions associated with our value chain account for approximately 90% of our total GHG emissions, with Category 1 (Purchased Goods and Services), Category 2 (Capital Goods) and Category 4 (Upstream Transportation and Distribution) being the largest contributors.
In 2023, Lilly's total Scope 3 emissions were 5,139,500 metric tonnes CO2e. Our increase in Scope 3 emissions versus the prior year is primarily attributed to the increased spend on purchased goods and services driven by the company's accelerated growth during this period. Additionally, other contributing factors include external updates to the US Environmentally-Extended Input- Output (USEEIO) codes and the associated emission factors, and other evolutionary methodology changes that further influenced the overall increase in Lilly’s calculated Scope 3 emissions. In an evolving Scope 3 data capture and calculation environment, we expect
to consider best practices each year to provide best estimates where possible.
We are working to advance transparency across our value chain, including in our Scope 3 emissions. We have begun to engage with key suppliers and identify areas of our value chain where we could potentially drive emissions reductions. We intend to use the data gathered through our supplier engagement efforts to inform our evolving supply chain strategy related to climate change.
Our aim is to find ways to collaborate across our industry peers and supply chain sectors to advance our understanding of our entire value chain, their activities and impact on our Scope 3 emissions. We are also investigating opportunities to engage with suppliers to better track and analyze our supply chain emissions. Lilly’s 2023 Scope 3 emissions breakdown is shown
in the figure below. Lilly’s 2024 Scope 3 emissions breakdown is expected to be available in Q3 2025.

1 Presented in alignment with Lilly’s basis of reporting for key environmental sustainability indicators. A location-based method reflects the average emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs (using mostly grid-average emission factor data). A market-
based method reflects emissions from electricity that companies have purposefully chosen (or their lack of choice). It derives emission factors from contractual instruments, which include any type of contract between two parties for the sale and purchase of energy bundled with attributes about the energy generation, or for unbundled attribute claims. See GHP Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. In 2020, Lilly did not differentiate between market-based and location- based emissions calculations.

At Lilly, we are committed to minimizing waste to conserve energy, resources and landfill space. We understand that the most effective way to reduce waste is to not create it in the first place. We are committed to green chemistry and efficiency and endeavor to reduce waste at the source, including minimizing the use of hazardous materials that can often become hazardous waste at the end of the manufacturing process. We explore ways to reuse materials from our processes
and send waste for recycling when feasible. For the remaining waste, where feasible, we strive to recover energy and treat waste to reduce toxicity and volume. We strive to only send waste to landfills as a last resort or when legally required. We also recognize that plastic waste is one of our world’s most pressing issues and are taking steps to reduce our footprint.

 2030 Waste Goals and
Our Progress to Date
We have established waste goals to reduce landfill waste, address plastic waste from our operations and support integration of sustainability into the designs of our products.
Zero waste to landfill from routine operations
In 2024, 20 out of Lilly’s 32 facilities achieved the zero-landfill target, resulting in 1.1% of our waste from routine operations being sent to landfill. The number of our facilities reaching the zero-landfill target increased and there was an overall decrease from 2023 in the aggregate percentage of routine operational waste being sent to landfill.
100% of plastic waste repurposed for beneficial use, with at least 90% recycled or reused
In 2024, we were able to repurpose 95.7% of plastic waste for beneficial use (reuse/recycle/waste-to- energy), primarily driven by the recycling of plastics from our manufacturing processes and incoming packaging material. Of this plastic waste, 86.6% was recycled or reused. The plastic waste recycling percentage in 2024 decreased compared to 2023 primarily due to a single event at the Japan manufacturing facility where non- recyclable plastic packaging material was received.

to achieving our established plastic waste goals, we anticipate that it will take significant efforts – such as new technologies and innovative external capacity – to achieve 100% beneficial use and at least 90% reused or recycled plastic waste.
Plastic Reuse and Recycling at
Manufacturing Facility
As part of our commitment to continually improve our environmental impact, we optimize plastic use at our manufacturing facilities through reuse and recycling programs. As part of these programs, packaging
from incoming materials can be recycled and used as feedstocks for other products such as composite decking, furniture and carpet padding.
Reducing Waste from Our Cafeterias
At our headquarters in Indianapolis, Indiana, we
have eliminated nearly all polystyrene foam materials from our cafeterias and transitioned to biobased to-go containers and other more environmentally friendly materials.
We have transitioned the majority of our plastic bottled drinks to aluminum cans. The shift to aluminum, which boasts higher recycling rates than plastic, aligns with
our environmental sustainability goals. Additionally, we collect and recycle food-related cardboard packaging and compost kitchen prep food waste, which can be used to augment fertilizer needs for a commercial farm.
At many of our facilities in Europe, our food service providers have focused on elimination of single-
use plastics for items such as cutlery, plates, drink accessories (stirrers and straws) and take-away bags.

Managing Waste Across
Our Operations
In 2024, Lilly generated 125,000 metric tonnes of waste, representing a 4% reduction in total waste versus 2020. This reduction was achieved while increasing manufacturing production rates across the same period. Most of the waste generated by Lilly is considered non-hazardous by relevant regulatory authorities.
The remaining waste we generate that is considered hazardous is carefully stored, packaged and shipped to approved treatment facilities, some of which recover energy from the waste. We strive to send hazardous waste to landfills when there is no other option or when required by law.
Plastic Waste
Reduction Efforts
We are focused on minimizing our plastic waste footprint. To do this, we reduce the generation of plastic waste where possible, identify where recycled plastic materials are suitable for use in our processes and maximize the reuse and recycling of plastic waste. When reduction, reuse and recycling are not viable, we send plastic waste to a facility that converts waste into energy.
We were able to repurpose 95.7% of our plastic waste for beneficial use (reuse/recycle/waste-to-energy) in 2024, primarily driven by the recycling of plastics from

 Integrating Sustainability
into Our Product and
Packaging Design Processes
To support our 2030 waste goals, we continue to
build on efforts to incorporate sustainability into
the lifecycle of our products, delivery devices and packaging, with waste reduction in mind. Our goal is to integrate sustainability-focused design principles into future product and packaging design processes, while identifying and evaluating opportunities to enhance our current portfolio, including labeling in some markets that will better inform the patient on disposal. We aspire to develop products that are inclusive, trustworthy
and sustainable.
Inclusive
We strive to design intuitive experiences that are inclusive of the unique capabilities and changing conditions of people around the world and that meet their diverse abilities and needs.
Trustworthy
We demonstrate care and compassion for people
and aim to create devices and packaging that are consistent, reliable and easy to learn and use across all touchpoints.
Sustainable
We strive to design our therapies, devices, packaging and experiences for longevity and minimal environmental impact.
We aim to make our products more sustainable without sacrificing safety, regulatory requirements, user experience or patient outcomes. We strive to position our products at the top of our “reduce, reuse, recycle” waste hierarchy, and design for recyclability while also reducing medical waste and electronic waste. We are investing in research to identify renewable/bio-based materials to make our future packaging and devices more sustainable. We are also exploring collaborations and partnerships with our key materials suppliers to evaluate the feasibility of improving the sustainability of existing devices.
Lilly has developed a Design for Sustainability Guidebook to support the design of our next generation of delivery devices to meet Lilly’s environmental goals. The guidebook is used internally to provide insights into sustainability approaches in device and secondary packaging design, materials, and recycling. It aims
to increase knowledge in this space and explore best practices when designing our devices and packaging in a regulated environment.
Drug Delivery Devices
For Lilly’s existing drug delivery devices, we focus on the selection of materials and waste reduction and recyclability strategies to improve sustainability. We strive to incorporate additional sustainable design elements into future platforms.

• Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) – We have advanced our understanding of the carbon footprint for multiple devices, including both existing devices and devices in development, by conducting detailed lifecycle analyses of these devices. The lifecycle analyses were conducted in accordance with ISO 14040, which is
a recognized international standard for assessment of the environmental aspects of a product or service in its entire lifecycle. Lifecycle analyses help identify key opportunities for reducing our carbon footprint using alternative materials, secondary packaging, transportation and manufacturing. We will continue to evaluate these opportunities, without impacting the supply of medicines to our patients. In addition, we have developed in-house LCA expertise to drive analysis of our next generation devices during the innovation stages. The effort is aimed at integrating sustainable principles into the next generation devices right from the start.
• Device Molding Evaluations (Proof of Concept) – We started evaluating and identifying renewable materials that could be used as alternatives to existing plastic materials used in our devices. We conducted proof-of-concept (PoC) trials
to make plastic components using renewable materials. Additionally, we continue to investigate energy efficient ways of molding the plastics used in our devices with the goal of reducing energy consumption.

 • Packaging Optimization – We are working to reduce packaging and transition to eco-friendly materials
where possible. Additionally, the pharmaceutical
industry has begun to evaluate the potential to move,
as the default, to electronic patient information • leaflets instead of printed materials. We recognize
there are many aspects to consider, such as regulatory requirements, patient preference and access to technology. However, we are committed to working with stakeholders to assess and understand opportunities to reduce waste through technological advancements and digitization.
• Take-Back and Recycling – We are exploring new ways to address end-of-lifecycle product waste. We have initiated pilot programs for device take-back and recycling processes, however, these solutions are not yet available in all geographies or at large scale. Learn more about our Product Stewardship efforts.
Packaging
We consider many sustainability factors in selecting product packaging, including material use and recyclability. Pharmaceutical packaging must meet stringent regulatory and internal standards. In some cases, this prevents us from using recycled content, as
is the case with container closure systems that come into direct contact with our products. However, we have started working with suppliers on the implementation of recycled content materials in our paper-based secondary

packaging. We continually seek to improve packaging design to reduce the amount of packaging used, use lower-impact materials and promote recyclability.
Pulp-Based Clinical Trial Packaging Change – Our efforts to improve the environmental impact
of our packaging goes beyond our commercial products and extends to potential future products currently undergoing clinical trials. Our clinical trial organization has begun to implement pulp-based solutions for device packaging. We are one of the very early adopters to use this pulp packaging option that, like plastics, can be injection molded into a variety of shapes. Use of this eco-friendly packaging option has reduced the size of drug delivery device packaging cartons compared to the original packaging design. This reduction in size also translates to shipping and transportation savings.
 Sales and Marketing
Lilly leverages technology to evolve our business and reduce our environmental footprint, such as digital media for promotional materials. In addition, systems to improve inventory management by reducing low-use printed materials and controlling print quantities are in place to reduce paper waste.

Water is essential to our operations and the facilities where we discover and manufacture our medicines,
and we’re committed to using this critical resource efficiently. We aim to manage water more sustainably by reducing our water footprint and avoiding potential risks related to pharmaceuticals in the environment (PiE).
We assess our water risks, and while we generally operate in locations where the risk of water scarcity and poor quality are low, we continue to focus on conserving and reducing water use and improving the quality of
the water we discharge from our facilities. We work
with our sites around the world to identify water-saving opportunities and wastewater treatment technologies to support our environmental goals. We have reported on our water programs through CDP, including through our latest CDP Water Security response.
2030 Water Goals and
Our Progress to Date
We have established water-related goals that include establishing and implementing water management plans for all Lilly sites in water-stressed areas, as well as maintaining our internal and external manufacturing operations to meet predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC) for Pharmaceuticals in the Environment.
Establishing and implementing water management plans for Lilly sites in water-stressed areas
100% of our manufacturing sites located in water- stressed areas have developed water stress management plans. Each water stress management plan includes localized targets and initiatives with specific delivery dates related to reducing water stress where these sites operate. Each site continues to progress their water management plans.
100% of Lilly sites meet predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC) for Pharmaceuticals in the Environment
In 2024, 100% of Lilly manufacturing sites met pharmaceutical PNEC values established by the
Lilly Aquatic Exposure Guideline (LAEG) program. Furthermore, all our manufacturing sites achieved wastewater discharges less than 10% of PNEC-based limits established for pharmaceuticals.
Ensured appropriate controls were in place with
Lilly contract manufacturers to prevent discharge of pharmaceuticals in wastewater above applicable PNEC- based limits for Pharmaceuticals in the Environment
Through the end of 2024, Lilly completed assessments of 100% of our contract manufacturers. All contract manufacturers were found to have appropriate controls in place to meet the established PNEC-based limits.

Managing Water-Stressed Geographies
The water stress management plans were developed based on guidance in the Alliance for Water Stewardship International Water Stewardship Standard V2.0 (AWS Standard). The AWS Standard has five outcomes that represent fundamental aspects of water. The intent of these outcomes is to act as fundamental “pillars” of water stewardship – or themes that are reflected in all water stewardship efforts.
1. How humans are responsible and accountable for water (governance)
2. Quantities and timing of water (water balance)
3. Properties of the water (water quality)
4. Spatial aspects of areas that may or may not contain water at a given time, but that are critical to maintaining the human-derived benefits of water including the ecosystem services from Important Water-Related Areas (IWRAs)
5. Provision of safe water, sanitation and hygiene for all.
Pharmaceuticals in the
Environment (PiE)
Pharmaceuticals, the active ingredients of medicines, have been found in surface waters, groundwater, sediment, and soil. Reported concentrations of pharmaceuticals detected in the environment are usually extremely low. Pharmaceuticals may enter the environment through effluents from pharmaceutical manufacturing or through excretion by patients after therapeutic use of a medicine. They may also enter
the environment through improper disposal of unused medicines. There are various public and stakeholder concerns regarding pharmaceuticals in the environment (PiE). The detection and biological potency of pharmaceuticals raise questions about potential risks to the environment. Additionally, there are concerns about the impact of the pharmaceutical supply chain on human health, especially in countries that may lack rigorous environmental protection standards. The World Health Organization, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Geological Survey have all concluded
that the presence of pharmaceuticals in drinking
water is unlikely to have a direct impact on human health. Recent publications by Gunnarsson et al. (2019) and Wilkinson et al. (2022) conclude that for most pharmaceuticals, presence in surface water presents
a low risk to environmental species, whether based on predicted or measured environmental concentrations.

Water Use
Manufacturing operations account for most of our water use. The production of injectable medicines requires exceptionally high-quality water, and our sites rely on utility operations to produce purified water and water for cooling systems and steam boilers. To reduce our water consumption, we use reclaimed water when possible and have optimized our cooling systems to reduce water usage. In 2024, our facilities recycled or reused 290 billion liters of water, representing 97.5% of our total water demand.
In 2024, 7.5% of our total water intake occurred at sites in geographies that are defined as “water stressed." Potential future regional water risk, unpredictable costs and climate change concerns have further strengthened our commitment to using water more efficiently and improving water quality based on local needs. Hence, we have established water management plans for Lilly sites located in water-stressed geographies.
    25 | 2024 Sustainability Report

        Our Strategy
Environmental Social Governance Transparency
 We believe the discharge of pharmaceuticals into the environment should be minimized. We strive to ensure our internal and external manufacturing operations
do not adversely impact waterways due to discharges of pharmaceuticals.
PiE Governance
Due to the importance of the topic of pharmaceuticals
in the environment (PiE) to Lilly and our stakeholders, Lilly has a PiE Governance Committee that sets strategic direction related to PiE and provides long-term oversight of Lilly’s Aquatic Exposure Guideline (LAEG) program that controls the discharges of pharmaceuticals from manufacturing sites. The PiE Governance Committee reports directly to our Global HSE Committee. Read more about our HSE Governance.
PiE Risk Assessment
We assess the pharmaceuticals in our medicines for potential environmental impacts before introducing a medicine to market. To do this we use environmental risk assessment procedures that are aligned with several global regulatory agencies.
We assess the environmental risk posed by patient use of our medicines as part of the approval process for new medicines in the U.S. and Europe.
We also assess the environmental risk posed by the manufacturing of our medicines as part of our internal Lilly Aquatic Exposure Guideline (LAEG) program. The results drive appropriate treatment and containment strategies at our manufacturing sites to protect
aquatic species in downstream surface waters and the communities and wildlife using these waters. The LAEG program has been in place for more than three decades at Lilly facilities, and we are now fully implementing LAEG assessments at contract manufacturers across our supply chain. Lilly has committed to compliance with LAEG requirements at our manufacturing facilities and to ensure controls are in place at our contract manufacturers to prevent harmful discharge of our active pharmaceutical ingredients.
Collaborations and Partnerships for Understanding and Mitigating PiE
We continue to partner with industry, academia and governments to improve both our understanding of and response to PiE. Lilly scientists and technical experts have been engaged in the following efforts:
• Collaborating on Novel PiE Assessment – We are currently engaged in a second Innovative Medicines Initiative consortium project, the Prioritization and Risk Evaluation of Medicines in the EnviRonment (PREMIER). This six-year project aims to deliver
a novel assessment system for characterizing
the environmental risks of pharmaceuticals while addressing several of the actions stated in the EU’s published Strategic Approach to PiE. As part of this project, we are collecting environmental data on prioritized legacy pharmaceuticals and contributing to the evaluation of the relationship of external and internal concentrations of pharmaceuticals in fish.
• Assessing the Potential for Designing Environmentally Biodegradable Pharmaceuticals – We participate in the American Chemistry Society’s Green Chemistry Institute Pharmaceutical Roundtable, a consortium of companies that is considering pharmaceuticals environmental biodegradation potential.
• Advancing the Science of PiE – We continue to support efforts to advance PiE-related research by authoring papers, serving as journal reviewers, presenting at conferences and workshops, and participating in meetings concerning the safety of pharmaceutical residues in water.
• Partnering on Take-Back Programs – In collaboration with regulators and other pharmaceutical companies, we are key partners in take-back programs for unused medicines such as MedsDisposal in Europe and Med-Project in the U.S.
• Engaging in Industry Initiatives – We participate
in several industry PiE initiatives, such as Eco- Pharmaco-Stewardship, a multi-faceted program developed with several pharmaceutical trade organizations (EFPIA, AEGSP, MFE).
• Developing PiE Tools and Resources – We are also actively engaged in creating tools and resources to share with industry peers, including in-person and online training on risk-based approaches to managing effluents, a user-friendly tool to calculate discharge limits for pharmaceuticals, an industry guidance document on controlling pharmaceutical discharge and audit protocols to evaluate PiE supply chain risks.

1 “Water intake” is the total amount of water coming into a site, including water pumped from bodies of surface water and groundwater, as well as water provided by a utility. It includes water used in processes, utilities and other ancillary operations, such as irrigation. The term does not include groundwater pumped solely for treatment to satisfy regulatory actions or requirements (e.g., remediation activities where the water is not used for another purpose). Values do not include the water extracted from wells solely for the purpose of lowering the groundwater table(s) to maintain the physical and structural integrity of building foundations. Totals include a small amount of rainwater intake not included in other water intake subcategories. Lilly does not generally collect water data from small locations that house primarily administrative activities such as sales and marketing offices unless they are co-located at a Lilly manufacturing or research facility.

Management Approach
Each stage of the pharmaceutical product life cycle includes distinct environmental considerations
and opportunities. We take a broad approach to understanding and managing potential environmental issues across our value chain, from development of
new medicines to product end-of-life and disposal considerations. As the phase of research and development significantly influences the environmental footprint of pharmaceutical manufacturing, we integrate sustainability-focused design principles – such as
green chemistry and end-product engineering – early in product development. These design principles help identify and reduce health, safety and environmental impacts from production processes when possible. As our product portfolio evolves and grows, we continue to search for new and better ways to reduce our environmental footprint across the life cycle of our products.

 Managing Environmental Performance Across the Product Life Cycle
Patient Use
Our circularity-based strategy includes integrating sustainability across the value-chain toward the ultimate goal of fostering a positive impact on patients and
the planet.
  The work we do starts with the patient in mind. We are committed to making a positive impact on people, society and the planet. We aspire to develop products that are inclusive, trustworthy and sustainable to achieve the highest level of safety, user experience and patient outcomes with all of our products.
Research and Development
We consider environmental factors beginning with the earliest stages of design and development. We use the 12 principles of green chemistry, environmental risk assessments, packaging manufacturing reviews and an environmental development review process to evaluate potential environmental impacts during the scale-up of production to manufacturing levels.
Materials and Natural Resources
Our stakeholders, including customers, governments and suppliers worldwide, are increasingly focused on the materials and chemicals used to make pharmaceutical products. A key component of our sustainability strategy is to reduce our carbon footprint by continuing to increase the use of environmentally friendly materials and processes. Additionally, through our chemical management program, we work to reduce our use of materials, water and other natural resources when possible.
Manufacturing
We recognize that our manufacturing processes require the use of valuable natural resources. Our priorities include compliance with applicable HSE regulations, policies, procedures and standards as we work to continually improve our environmental performance related to energy efficiency, waste minimization and water management. We strive to reduce Lilly’s environmental impacts associated with our own manufacturing processes as well as our contract manufacturing organizations.
Product Transportation and Logistics
We consider many factors when selecting product packaging, including sustainability aspects such as materials reuse and recyclability. We have formed a green logistics team that seeks to optimize both shipment volumes and transportation methods to reduce packaging materials and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
Product End-of-Life
Our product journey is circular and always comes back to where it started – the patient. We work with stakeholders to ensure cost-effective approaches are available for product end-of-life disposal that balance environmental protection, patient safety and privacy, legal compliance and security.
We commit to understanding the potential effects of pharmaceuticals in the environment (PiE). We support using science-based evaluations to assess and reduce the environmental risks of our pharmaceutical products. Through collaborations with industry partners, academic researchers and regulatory agencies, we continually work to further understand and proactively address any potential impacts from our products.
            29 | 2024 Sustainability Report

        Green Chemistry
Green chemistry has been a focus at Lilly for many years. From the selection of candidate molecules through the identification of manufacturing processes, our development teams engage in a variety of activities during research and development to design sustainably, including:
• Eliminating or reducing the hazardous materials or chemicals of concern used to make a product
• Focusing on removal of substances of very high concern (SVHC) as classified by the European Chemicals Agency
• Shrinking the waste profiles of certain molecules through reduced solvent and water use
• Increasing the overall efficiency of material use
• Advancing the underlying green chemistry of medicine development and making production both safer and more environmentally friendly through a commitment to continuous process improvement
• Implementing new manufacturing technologies that minimize environmental impact, including continuous flow processes, which Lilly has worked to advance in the pharmaceutical industry.
By employing green chemistry, we strive to enhance the safety profile of manufacturing processes by reducing the risk of the most hazardous manufacturing steps. We are also focused on the adoption of greener and safer solvents where possible. For example, we have replaced several hazardous solvents and hazardous
air pollutants with safer alternatives in our chemical synthesis operations.
Lilly Research
We continue to advance green chemistry through our own research, and several of our findings were published in scientific journals. Highlights include:
• Synthetic Molecule Design & Development – Co-authored a paper which captures the first systemic metrics study for synthetic peptides that warrants more environmentally friendly processes in peptide manufacturing.
• Patent for Greener Medicine – Developed improvements in solvent efficiency and published
a process patent and manuscript describing continuous chemistry for Lilly’s once-weekly dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor.
External Collaborations
Lilly actively pursues broader industry collaborations to help advance green chemistry through a combination of dialogue and leadership with peer companies, scientific partnerships and research sponsorships. We are actively engaged in collaborations with the American Chemical Society (ACS) Pharmaceutical Roundtable and the
IQ Consortium’s Green Chemistry Working Group to promote the Green Aspiration Level (GAL) tool and support ongoing development of industry standards. Lilly currently holds a leadership role within the ACS Pharmaceutical Roundtable, which has recently grown to over 50 member companies and serves as the primary organization advancing pre-competitive sustainability initiatives.
In collaboration with industry peers, we have worked
to improve the iGAL metric. Yield, and convergence
have been added as new key sustainability indicators, including introduction of a new convergence formula with potential applicability in computer assisted synthesis planning (CASP) algorithms. The improved statistical model of iGAL 2.0 represents a valuable extension to the common API process waste metrics, process mass intensity (PMI) and complete E factor (cEF). We believe that iGAL 2.0 can readily be adopted by pharmaceutical firms around the globe and thereby empower and inspire their scientists to make meaningful and significant contributions to sustainability.

These regulations may require replacing chemicals identified as hazardous with safer alternatives,
when available. To address these concerns, we have implemented a formal program and screening process to evaluate designated “chemicals of concern” throughout the pharmaceutical research and development process. Our process also addresses mitigation steps where
new restrictions may impact our existing operations. This assists us with ensuring that our facilities and supply chain remain in compliance with chemical management laws.
During the scale-up of medicine production to manufacturing levels in our pharmaceutical business, we use an Environmental Development Review process to evaluate other potential environmental issues and opportunities. This process identifies and addresses potential impacts arising from manufacturing, suggests process improvements and facilitates learning as
new medicines transition from the laboratory to the manufacturing facility.
Ensuring that our medicines have a smaller impact on the environment does not stop with green chemistry. We also focus extensively on water use, waste and Pharmaceuticals in the Environment (PiE). Learn more about our waste and water efforts.
Product End-of-Life
Unlike many consumer products that can be recycled or are composed of materials that can be reclaimed
at the end of their usefulness, many of our medicines are, by nature, different. Public health regulations
often prohibit the use of recovered materials from pharmaceutical products like those produced by Lilly. We continue to work with customers, industry partners and public health officials to address these product end-of-life issues.
We promote policy decisions that are efficient, effective and protect both human health and the environment. We also support educating patients and caregivers on proper
disposal of medicines and syringes, needles and other sharps used in home settings. We communicate this information to patients through product user manuals and The Lilly Answers Center, a hotline that answers frequently asked questions about our products.
We are a member of the Pharmaceutical Product Stewardship Work Group (PPSWG), a U.S.-
based membership association that coordinates pharmaceutical manufacturer efforts to respond to state and local household medicine and sharps takeback laws. We are a participating company in MED-Project USA and MED-Project LLC (“MED-Project”), owned by PPSWG, which serve as the stewardship organization designated by PPSWG members to implement and operate mandated household unwanted medicine and sharps take-back programs. The MyOldMeds.com website is provided by PPSWG as an easy way for patients to find a site near them to dispose of unwanted, unused or expired medicines from households.
We also engage with other industry stakeholders on these matters in the EU, such as European Federation
of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), and in Canada Health Products Stewardship Association.
Device Take-Back and Recycling
We are also committed to investigating ways
to mitigate plastic waste by exploring potential
new options to reduce end-product waste. Lilly is exploring opportunities individually and with industry collaborations that include:
• Efforts led by pharmaceutical associations
• Collaborations with other pharmaceutical and device
manufacturing companies
• Supplier-led sustainability collaborations.
In addition, we are providing financial and resource support to potential partners for the testing newer technologies that could lead to recycling and reuse of plastic after our devices are used by patients.
• United States - Lilly is working with several recyclers to assess the feasibility of their process for recycling Lilly devices. Once the feasibility is established, the goal is to scale up the technology for potential device recycling programs more broadly.
• Germany – Lilly is conducting a device take-back pilot program in Germany. This effort was initially launched with a limited number of hospitals in 2020 and has since been expanded to include more health care offices and hospitals in Germany. The collected

 devices are being used in recycling studies to assess methods of recovering plastics and other materials. This program is a step in our efforts to increase
the circularity of our devices and minimize their environmental impact.
• Denmark – Lilly has joined a collaborative effort
with Novo Nordisk, Sanofi and Merck to pioneer the • world's first cross-industry solution for recycling
injection pens. This pilot program was launched in
Denmark in May 2023, leveraging the country’s
existing recycling infrastructure. The ambitious
target for the program is for 25% of all injection pens distributed by the four companies in Denmark to
be recycled.
• France – Lilly, in collaboration with Sanofi, has
joined RECYPEN, the first recycling effort for insulin injection pens in France. RECYPEN is an initiative led by DASTRI, the national eco-organization approved to collect and treat waste from health care activities.
This pilot program for recycling insulin injection pens from Lilly and Sanofi launched in 2024 in four pilot regions: Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, Grand Est, Hauts- de-France and Occitanie. The program will be tested for an initial one-year period and aims to collect 30% of the pens used by patients in these regions.
UK – The Circularity in Primary Pharmaceutical Packaging Accelerator (CiPPPA) launched a new initiative with ambitions for waste reduction and environmental stewardship, such as the development of effective end-of-life product management of pharmaceutical packaging and diverting waste
from landfill sites. Lilly, along with other leading pharmaceutical companies, global over-the-counter (OTC) brands and health care systems such as the NHS, has joined CiPPPA in this collaborative initiative focused on packaging solutions surrounding blisters, inhalers and injectables.

Case Studies
Kinsale Harbor Study Kinsale Harbor Study
To study the impact of our manufacturing facilities
on the local aquatic environment, our site in Kinsale, Ireland initiated a longstanding evaluation of aquatic habitat quality and benthic biodiversity in 1978. Managed by the National University of Ireland Galway, the Kinsale Harbour Study is one of the longest studies of marine coastline conducted anywhere in the world. The evaluation has not identified evidence of adverse impacts on habitat quality and benthic biodiversity in the study area due to wastewater discharge from the Kinsale site. Results have been published in peer-reviewed scientific publications and several project reports. This project continues to support academic research for university students.

 Leading the Industry in Ecologically Sound Endotoxin Testing
Lilly continues to be an industry leader in using recombinant Factor C (rFC) testing, a scientifically proven, sustainable alternative to the horseshoe crab- sourced testing reagent, Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL). Both tests seek out the presence of harmful bacterial toxins in the injectable medicine manufacturing process.
Multiple peer-reviewed studies have evaluated and established comparability of rFC and LAL testing, using both standard and environmental endotoxins. This is especially important now given that several species
of crabs are under threat or endangered from habitat loss and overharvesting, which negatively affects the ecosystems inhabited by horseshoe crabs and
other species.
Currently, Lilly has converted 80% of our testing
of medicines from LAL to rFC testing. We began to implement rFC testing in 2016. Lilly now uses rFC testing in all our injectable manufacturing facilities
and for all our new injectable medicines. We have also implemented the method at several external partner sites and are actively working to convert additional sites. Lilly medicines using rFC testing for batch release have been approved by global health authorities and contribute to the health of millions of people around the world.
Lilly supports and is pleased to see broader use of rFC in the pharmaceutical industry. This is not new science – rFC is derived from recombinant biotechnology, which Lilly has pioneered since 1982. As more pharmaceutical companies move away from LAL and embrace rFC, the environment and ecosystems in key parts of the world will benefit – all while maintaining patient safety.
External Collaborations and
Partnerships
Biodiversity is a broad topic, and it is important to understand where the pharmaceutical sector can
make a difference. Recognizing this, Lilly is proactively engaged in collaborative efforts with external partners and industry working groups to assess and prioritize the risks to biodiversity.
This collaborative approach is a critical element for refining Lilly's biodiversity strategy and implementation plan. By actively involving external stakeholders, including environmental organizations, research institutions and industry peers, we can better
ensure that our strategies are informed by a holistic understanding of biodiversity-related risks
and opportunities.
Biodiversity Research Collaboration
Lilly conducted a collaborative biodiversity project with the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). This project assessed the implication of the Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) frameworks, which emerged following COP15, on sites where we operate. The collaboration also evaluated TNFD's LEAP (Locate, Evaluate, Assess and Prepare) approach for Lilly's global sites, excluding upstream operations.
This analysis has helped inform prioritization of biodiversity-related projects.

2 List Price represents the weighted average year-over-year change in the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC).
Average Lilly Net Price
 Pricing in the U.S.
  At Lilly, we know that pricing our medicines is one of the most important decisions we make as a company. We use a value-based approach to pricing, taking into account the following:
• Customer Perspective – The unmet needs that medicines can fulfill for patients and caregivers and how people can affordably access the treatment.
• Company Considerations – The costs of research, development, manufacturing, distribution and support services for customers; business trends and other economic factors; and the medicine’s potential market size and patent life.
• Competitive Landscape – The benefits of our medicine compared to alternative medicines and where our medicine is appropriate for treating conditions.
• Contributing Factors – Such as health system changes and policy guidelines.
Lilly also makes price adjustments over a product’s lifecycle that are based on the factors above as well as post-approval clinical and patient outcome data.
We seek to educate stakeholders about the value of our medicines and to provide transparency about our prices. List prices for many of our medicines, as well as average out-of-pocket costs and financial assistance information, are published online.
List Price vs. Net Price
A list price for each of our medicines is set using the considerations noted above.
We pay rebates, other discounts, and fees to payers, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), the U.S. government and other supply chain entities such as wholesalers and distributors. After paying these rebates, discounts and channel costs, the final dollar amount that Lilly ultimately receives is called the net price.
These rebates and discounts have continued to grow over the years for Lilly’s U.S. portfolio while net prices for many of our medicines have continued to decrease.

Affordability Solutions
We’re a medicine company turning science into healing to make life better for as many people as possible. We work to improve access to our treatments and increase equity throughout the health care system. We actively advocate for and participate in the process of driving systemic positive changes.
We support the realignment of financial incentives for the entire pharmaceutical supply chain so that patients directly benefit from the net pricing we provide. We are also taking important steps within our own control to increase access to Lilly medicines today.
Lilly offers a variety of affordability solutions through patient support programs and copay assistance across the major products in our portfolio. For many of our migraine, immunology, diabetes and obesity medicines, we have copay assistance programs to bring eligible, commercially insured patients’ monthly out-of-pocket costs to as little as $35 or lower. For cancer, the Lilly Oncology Support Center assists eligible patients
in identifying affordability options related to their Lilly treatment. The Lilly Diabetes Solution Center is a resource for patients to learn about our insulin affordability solutions, which are outlined in Insulin Affordability below.
LillyDirect®
Lilly launched LillyDirect®, a digital health care platform, to ease the burden of navigating a complex U.S. health care system for patients living with obesity, diabetes, sleep apnea, migraine and Alzheimer's Disease. LillyDirect®offers people more choices as to how and where they access health care, including via home delivery of select Lilly medicines by licensed third-party dispensing providers and listing both in-person and telehealth independent care providers as options.
Through LillyDirect®Self Pay Pharmacy Solutions, patients with an on-label prescription from a licensed prescriber can access our obesity medicines at a discount if not using insurance. Our 2.5 mg and 5 mg single-dose vials are available at a 50% or greater discount compared to the list price of all other incretin (GLP-1) medicines for obesity. The 7.5 mg and 10 mg single-dose vials are available at $499 per month
if certain conditions are met. This new option helps millions of adults with obesity access the medicine they need, including those not eligible for our savings card program, those without employer coverage, and those who need to self-pay outside of insurance. The self-pay
channel removes some third-party supply chain entities and allows patients to access savings directly outside of insurance.
Insulin Affordability
Over the past several years, Lilly has introduced multiple insulin affordability solutions, including our Lilly Insulin Value Program. As a result of our efforts, anyone — whether they are uninsured or use commercial insurance — is eligible to buy their monthly prescription of Lilly insulin for $35 or less, regardless of the number of
pens or vials they are prescribed in a month (terms and conditions apply). Over the last number of years Lilly has taken additional steps to make it even easier for people to access Lilly insulin including:
• Reducing the list price of our most commonly prescribed insulins by 70%.
• Automating the $35 out-of-pocket monthly cap for people with commercial insurance at participating retail pharmacies.
• Cutting the price of our non-branded insulin, insulin lispro, which is the same molecule as Humalog,
to $25 per vial, making it the lowest list-priced mealtime insulin available.
• Launching a biosimilar basal insulin, RezvoglarTM, at a lower list price.
Under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), millions
of Medicare beneficiaries who take insulin pay $35 per month or less for their insulin. Lilly was a strong supporter of this provision as it aligns with the affordability solutions we’ve had in-place years before the IRA became law.

Both web- and app-based, getinsulin.org is a convenient one- stop shop for people who use insulin and is available in both English and Spanish.
Long-Term Policy Solutions
Lilly is actively working with other stakeholders throughout the U.S. health care system, including Congress, to seek policy solutions to address systemic gaps in patient affordability. Some of these include:
• Lower Out-of-Pocket Costs – We support basing patient out-of-pocket costs for medicines on the lower net price that health plans and pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) pay after subtracting rebates and discounts they receive from manufacturers. Payer negotiated discounts are typically passed fully to patients for other health care services, but not for medicines. Lilly believes any rebate it pays should be passed through to people at the pharmacy counter to offset the cost of their medicines.
• Delinking – We support basing PBM fees on the value of the services they provide rather than a medicine’s price. Fees, rebates and other payments in the health care system are often calculated as a percentage of list price. By delinking PBM fees from list price, the incentive for high prices would be removed and could lower costs for patients.
• First-Dollar Coverage – We support exempting more health care items and services for chronic conditions – such as insulin – from patients’ deductibles.
This would improve patients’ access to necessary treatment and provide consistent costs every month.
• Insulin Out-of-Pocket Caps – We support expanding the monthly $35 copay cap on insulin in Medicare to the commercial market, a federal solution that would make permanent for all insulin users what Lilly has already done on its own.
• Transparency – We support additional transparency in the system. We commend legislation like the Pharmacy Benefit Manager Transparency Act
of 2023, which encourages fair and transparent practices that benefit local pharmacies
and consumers.
• Obesity Care Access – We support ensuring that
all patients can access evidence-based obesity
care including nutrition and exercise counseling, medications, and surgical interventions, regardless
of their insurance provider. We advocate for policies that recognize obesity as a chronic disease, deserving of comprehensive care and coverage, at parity with care and coverage of other chronic diseases.
We believe these necessary long-term reforms could provide lasting relief to patients struggling to access and afford their medicines regardless of manufacturer, moving the U.S. health care system from a series
of patchwork solutions toward systemic change. In the meantime, Lilly intends to continue providing affordability solutions to people who need them.
Value vs Volume: Linking Cost to Patient Outcome
When a patient seeks medical care, the health care system’s top goal should be to improve their health. Medical interventions, including medicines, should
be evaluated based on how well the patient’s health may improve. This seems obvious, but it’s not how our current payment system works.
Under the existing fee-for-service model that is common in the U.S., payments are based on the number of treatments or services provided, not whether a patient sees improvements in their health. However, as health care costs and rates of chronic disease continue to rise, there has been increased urgency to deliver care that brings greater value to both the patient and the health care system.
   41 | 2024 Sustainability Report

        Our Strategy
We believe that innovative value-based arrangements (VBAs) are an important part of the solution. VBAs allow Lilly to stand behind the health outcomes we expect our medicines to deliver when the medicines are used appropriately. Such arrangements are designed
to link the cost of our medicine more directly to patient outcomes.
A VBA includes predefined patient health outcomes and/or associated performance metrics based on
the observed impact of a particular medicine on the person taking it. Such metrics can include favorable test results, improved medication adherence, reduced re-hospitalization rates or reduction in overall disease management costs. This approach can transform the health care system to one that is about delivering value versus one about the volume of services provided or medicines purchased.
Lilly has been committed to increasing the use of VBAs in the U.S. since 2014. In addition, we have alternative access contracts in other global markets, many of which are value-based. We use each VBA as an opportunity to learn more about the real-world data we need to gather to make these arrangements more effective.
In many cases, VBAs improve access to a medicine
for eligible patients and many patients may also get more personalized care, given medicines in these arrangements are generally made available based on how well they work in specific subpopulations. For payers, VBAs can help them better maintain affordability in novel ways and pay for medicines that deliver outcomes. For companies like Lilly, these arrangements can increase access to their medicines and reinforce data from clinical studies with real-world evidence. And over the long term, the results from these arrangements may help inform and improve future research and development efforts.
We believe VBAs have the potential to improve
patient outcomes while lowering costs for the entire health care system, but to be successful they require increased collaboration between payers, health systems, employers, patients and industry. At Lilly, we continue to advocate for legislative and regulatory changes that support this transition. We believe this is one of the most important long-term changes we can make as
an industry.
Environmental Social Governance Transparency Health Literacy
We strive to provide patients with helpful and easy- to-understand information about our medicines and devices. This gives patients the very best chance to benefit from our innovative treatments. We do this by using something called “health literacy” when creating and designing our patient materials.
What is Health Literacy?
Health literacy is how well someone can access, understand and use health information to make decisions about their, or a loved one’s, health. Health literacy is more than just reading level — it also targets health-related skills and understanding, like knowing exactly when and how to use a medicine prescribed by a doctor to help patients feel more confident in taking good care of their health.
Lilly has eight health literacy principles that help us empower patients through information that’s clear and easy to understand. When we communicate clearly to our patients, we help remove barriers that can prevent better health for patients. This includes helping to reduce confusion that may come from cultural or language differences, which can help improve health equity for everyone, including those in traditionally underserved communities.
In a quest to make health literacy a priority companywide, Lilly developed an internal health literacy resource website to help teams independently create content and design materials for their various audiences. The tools and resources on this site can help employees assess documents for readability and appropriateness for intended audiences, identifying any potential issues that would make the materials difficult to understand.
Our health literacy approach isn’t required by the FDA or any other legal or regulatory body. We do it because we believe it’s the right thing to do, and it helps us deliver on our promise to make life better for people around
the world.

        Making Health Care More Affordable for Employees
Employers are spending more than ever to provide health benefits to their workers in the U.S. Yet many people, especially those with chronic illnesses, struggle with affordability and access to the care they need. If more employers reduce cost-sharing for high-value therapies – especially large employers – they could change the insurance market in ways that could improve health and productivity while constraining costs.
Like all employers, Lilly works every year to reduce the rising costs of health care for our organization. For more than a decade, we’ve offered exclusively high-deductible plans to our employees. But we take certain steps to make sure our high deductibles don’t lead our people to skip the care they need. We have implemented solutions in our own company consistent with the systemic changes for which we advocate.
We fund our employees’ health savings accounts
all at once at the beginning of the year. It shouldn’t matter if someone gets sick around New Year’s Day or Thanksgiving Day – we believe they should have money to help cover their health care costs. We provide first- dollar coverage for preventive and chronic disease medications by exempting them from our health plan deductibles. This means Lilly employees, retirees and their families pay only 10% to 20% of these medicines’ prices instead of the full retail price.
For all medicines, Lilly’s health plan has lowered costs by passing through rebates to patients at the point of sale. In addition, we provide all insulins to our eligible employees, retirees and family members at zero
cost. This helps our health plan members stay fully adherent to their therapy. Employees and their eligible family members with diabetes can also receive a free connected glucose meter and related supplies, along with real-time support from trained diabetes educators. For anti-obesity medicines, our health plan has opted into coverage for these therapies and we maintain an open formulary for anti-obesity medicines to give our members the choice of which medicine is best for them.
We believe corporate leaders across the U.S. can make longer-term decisions and trade-offs to more effectively manage health benefits. Working together, employers can advance good ideas and help provide a better way to make U.S. health care and health insurance work for
all Americans.
Medicine Donations
Beyond our affordability solutions, Lilly also donates medicines to tax-exempt organizations, including national relief organizations and the Lilly Cares Foundation, which provide Lilly medications for free to qualifying patients. Eligibility is determined by each tax- exempt organization.
The Lilly Cares Foundation, as a separate tax-exempt organization, helped more than 164,000 qualifying patients during 2024 obtain prescribed medications across the therapeutic areas of diabetes, immunology, neuroscience, cancer, pain, endocrinology, cardiovascular and bone, muscle and joint. Over the past 20 years, the Lilly Cares Foundation has helped more than 1 million patients with financial need receive medicines donated by Lilly.

Throughout our nearly 150-year history, Lilly has worked to address some of the most pressing health challenges facing humanity, including infections, diabetes, depression, cancer and obesity. In 2024, we estimate that more than 58 million people used Lilly medicines. However, our impact on health goes beyond the medicines we discover, develop and manufacture.
Through our global health efforts, Lilly is committed to addressing complex health challenges around the world. Our efforts focus on noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and people living in resource-limited communities in the U.S. and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We are committed to expanding equitable and affordable access to our breakthrough medicines so that they can transform more people’s lives.

The human toll of NCDs, including cancer and diabetes, is growing. According to the World Health Organization, NCDs are the leading cause of death worldwide, claiming the lives of at least 43 million people in 2021 with 73% of NCD deaths occurring in LMICs, where infrastructure and resources can be limited. Lilly’s current portfolio of
     44 | 2024 Sustainability Report

        medicines and pipeline are focused on NCDs. Beyond our scientific innovations, we believe our deep knowledge and expertise can help close healthcare gaps and help address the growing burden of NCDs for people living in resource-limited communities in the U.S. and LMICs.
Pricing Around the World
Our products are sold in approximately 95 countries around the world. Each country values medications
and innovation differently and must balance competing demands for finite resources, including other healthcare products and services, as well as meeting social needs, such as education or infrastructure.
Pricing medicines to achieve the optimal balance between affordable patient access and sustained investment in innovative treatments is complex. How to price medicines is one of the most important decisions we make as a company. When pricing a medicine, we use a value-based approach, reflecting the value provided to patients, providers, payers, caregivers, health systems and society. The approach also considers competitive dynamics and other factors. Drawing from this information, we evaluate country-specific conditions when pricing medicines on a market-by-market basis to help ensure patients around the world have affordable access to the innovative medicines we develop.
We support public policies to meet this same end. We explore new pricing and reimbursement models in different markets, and we advocate for policy changes that help increase access to medicines while protecting and enabling development of new medicines. For example, we support value-based and outcomes-based reimbursement models that can deliver greater health and economic value to health systems.
As a global company, we are aware that patients in LMICs face economic circumstances that may limit their ability to pay for health services and medicines. In response, Lilly is deploying alternative business models (see Lilly 30x30 below) and innovative collaborations to help provide high-quality, affordable Lilly medicines in these markets. We also support efforts to decrease the final price of medicines to patients in these countries, such as minimizing out-of-pocket costs and limiting markups across the supply chain.
Lilly’s Support of Universal Health Coverage
The need for resilient health systems that can handle emergencies while providing essential services, including for NCDs, is paramount. The global push for Universal Health Coverage (UHC) as part of the UN SDGs aims to ensure everyone has access to quality
health services and medicines without financial hardship. Achieving this requires collaboration across sectors, including with the private sector, to address UHC financing and implementation gaps. Lilly plays a crucial role by developing new medicines, extending the reach of existing medicines, and supporting health systems improvements.
See our Transparency section for more on how Lilly’s sustainability efforts support and advance progress on the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property (IP) protections play a central
role in driving innovations that result in better patient outcomes. Additionally, IP protections provide the necessary incentives to enable the global health ecosystem to operate. At Lilly, we use patent rights to protect meaningful innovation that enables sustainable investment in the high-risk and costly research and development required to discover, develop, and deliver innovative medicines. At the same time, we respect that of those IP rights, patents are limited in scope and duration, and we support robust generic and biosimilar competition when patent protections expire. Lilly is deeply committed to promoting both world-leading innovation and lower out-of-pocket costs for patients.
Sustaining robust, reliable, predictable, and
enforceable IP frameworks also promotes the pursuit
of breakthroughs in areas of unmet need, such as Alzheimer’s disease and antimicrobial resistance. By allowing some certainty in an otherwise high-risk, and high-investment endeavour like medicines development, IP protections keep the engines of innovation operating at full speed.
IP protections also improve patient access by expanding the innovation base, providing the pipeline for and driving entry of biosimilars and generics. Because of
the limited duration of patent protections, expiration
of those protections allows for shifts to generic and biosimilar medicines. These products create financial savings for patients and create budgetary headroom for health systems to expand access to newer medicines. Lilly supports healthy markets for generics and biosimilars, including removal of regulatory, pricing, reimbursement and access barriers when patent protections expire. In addition, Lilly continues to engage in approaches to patent in Least Developed Countries that takes into account their unique challenges. These may include voluntary licensing, non-assert policies or selective approaches to filing, in addition to supporting capacity-building initiatives which can foster a dynamic local innovation ecosystem.

Environmental
Social Governance Transparency Progress toward Lilly 30x30
Measuring Patient Reach
In 2024, the estimated Lilly 30x30 reach was 24 million people, on track toward our goal of reaching 30 million by 2030. Continued progress towards the target is enabled by Lilly’s continued global health support and implementing new ways of reaching people living in resource-limited settings.
To estimate the number of patients reached with Lilly medicines who live in resource-limited settings, we
use a mix of internal and external data. Internal inputs include reach estimates for our marketed products commercially distributed in these regions and medicines the company provides to organizations that distribute it for free to patients who qualify. External inputs include patient reach estimates from health organizations we support and from companies receiving venture impact investments from Lilly.
Pipeline
As a medicine company, our greatest contribution
to global health is the discovery and development of innovative medicines. We continue to engage external organizations with the goal of developing innovative solutions for diseases disproportionately affecting people living in resource-limited settings. Lilly has committed $50 million to investing in venture capital firms that specialize in near- and long-term healthcare solutions for patients in LMICs. Existing investments include but are not limited to:
• LeapFrog Emerging Consumer Fund IV. LeapFrog
is an impact growth equity fund investing in South and Southeast Asian and African businesses that, among other priorities, provide innovative healthcare solutions to low-income consumers by offering relevant and affordable products to promote wellness and help prevent and manage chronic diseases.
 In 2021, Lilly joined the IP PACT (IP Principles for Advancing Cures and Therapies), a multi-company initiative affirming the biopharmaceutical industry’s commitment to innovation and keeping patients at
the center of our work. The IP PACT includes ten principles guiding the way our industry uses IP, including to facilitate collaboration and partnerships, to act responsibly in patent proceedings and to support vibrant generic and biosimilar markets. The principles are intended to balance the needs of patients, society and our business — to further healthcare innovation and help patients live longer, healthier lives.
Lilly 30x30
Through investments in people, medicines and health systems, we strive to improve access to quality healthcare for 30 million people living in resource- limited settings annually by 2030. We call this global model Lilly 30x30. To achieve our goal, we are leveraging company resources and working with leading health organizations to increase access to medicines, including Lilly medicines and address complex global health challenges. We work to enhance health across three areas of impact:
• Pipeline – discovering medicines, repurposing internal assets and supporting external pipelines
• Programs – strengthening and creating new programs that help improve access to Lilly medicines

• Global Health Investment Corporation’s (GHIC) Global Health Security Portfolio. The Global Health Security portfolio is focused broadly on medical countermeasures that will better position the world to respond to or prevent public health emergencies, including vaccines, diagnostics, therapeutics, manufacturing platforms, and other critical technologies.
Lilly continues to be a top-tier investor in the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Action Fund, with $100 million committed over the life of the fund. The AMR Action Fund was launched in 2020 by more than 20 leading biopharmaceutical companies, including Lilly. Joining forces with global charitable organizations and development banks, the AMR Action Fund aims to accelerate antibiotic development. To date, the fund has made investments in ten U.S., European, and Asian biotech organizations with pipelines targeting a range of infections.
In 2023, through Lilly 30x30, we launched a new process to systematically evaluate internal assets to identify product development and access planning strategies for LMICs with the goal of accelerating our reach and scale. We will continue to explore potential opportunities and business development models that further support the development of our Lilly 30x30 pipeline, including venture impact investing.
Programs
Through Lilly 30x30, we are strengthening our existing programs and developing new approaches to improve access to Lilly products and services for people living in resource-limited settings. These efforts include exploring alternative business models and expanding access strategies and patient support programs.
Patient Support Programs
Lilly offers a variety of affordability solutions through patient support programs and copay assistance across the major products of our portfolio, including medicines for Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, obesity, migraine, immunology and cancer. We offer these programs across the globe. Our patient support programs fall into three categories:
• Supporting patients through reimbursement and product access issues
• Answering questions related to living with disease and managing health
• Providing information on Lilly medicines and training on Lilly devices.
Environmental Social Governance Transparency Alternative Access Programs
Lilly offers alternative access programs in addition to standard pricing, reimbursement and access models. These programs facilitate appropriate patient access to Lilly medicines by addressing specific challenges faced by patients, institutional payers, or channel partners.
We are also advancing manufacturing and public-private partnership-based solutions to expand access to our products in the countries where Lilly currently has no or limited presence.
An important program milestone is Lilly’s collaboration with EVA Pharma, which was launched in 2022 to deliver a sustainable supply of high-quality, affordable human and analog insulin to at least one million people annually living with type 1 and type 2 diabetes in LMICs, most of which are in Africa.
In 2024, Lilly and EVA Pharma announced the registration and release of the first locally manufactured insulin glargine injection in Egypt.
Also, in 2024, Lilly and EVA announced a collaboration in which Lilly will license certain baricitinib manufacturing know-how to enable EVA Pharma to manufacture
and supply the product across 49 LMICs in Africa. Discovered by Incyte and licensed to Lilly, baricitinib
is for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, alopecia areata, atopic dermatitis, and COVID-19.
Philanthropy (and Other Initiatives)
Lilly supports global health organizations in their efforts to strengthen local healthcare systems and improve access to quality healthcare in resource-limited settings across the world. We focus on championing innovative, sustainable, and scalable solutions to address
pressing global health concerns for NCDs, particularly cardiometabolic health, including obesity, diabetes, and cancer care. We aim to facilitate collective cross- industry action to develop and test integrated models of care that achieve better health outcomes for

 Our Strategy:
Empowering Inclusion
and Removing Barriers
Our value of Respect for People, originally articulated by Eli Lilly as “compassion for others,” has guided us for nearly 150 years. This value embodies our enduring commitment to Inclusion. By fostering a culture of inclusion where everyone feels valued and empowered, we are driving meaningful and lasting change. Our strategy is grounded in two areas that are essential to our journey:
Empowering a culture of inclusion for all to drive innovation and business outcomes
At Lilly, inclusion means everyone is respected and valued for their unique perspectives, feels they belong, and has access to the opportunities and resources needed to contribute their best. Our goal is to create
an environment where diversity is truly embraced, and every person feels recognized and appreciated. We strive to make inclusion an everyday practice such that it becomes second nature in our workplace. By fostering a culture of inclusion, we empower our employees to bring their unique perspectives to the table, which we believe leads to increased innovation, stronger problem-solving, and ultimately, better business outcomes.
Removing barriers for employees, patients and communities
We are dedicated to identifying and removing barriers that prevent individuals from reaching their best health.
Inclusion for All
Building an Accessible and Supportive Workplace for All
Advancing disability inclusion remains a priority as
we continue to create an accessible and supportive workplace. This includes recognizing the various resources that can contribute to individual and team success but also understanding employees may choose not to disclose a disability for various reasons, including
concerns about privacy or stigma. This is why our continued work on creating a disability-confident culture is grounded in trust and respect for people.
Using assistive technologies, reasonable workplace adjustments and accommodations when requested and continuous education on disability inclusion for all employees, we continue to foster a workplace where everyone can contribute to our mission.
In 2024, we completed the EnAble Employee Journey, guided by feedback from employees with disabilities and caregivers, to deepen our understanding and design a strategy that promotes barrier-free experiences and empowers productivity for all employees and customers. This strategy resulted in significant advancements, including the incorporation of best practices learned from the EnAble Journey into our employee engagement initiatives, the embedding of “accessibility” into
our Respect for People policy, and the creation of
a new leadership role—Head of Disability Inclusion
& Accessibility. This dedicated leader continues to develop and drive Lilly’s strategy for advancing disability inclusion both within Lilly and beyond, championing our efforts and collaborating with external organizations to influence positive change in our communities.
Veterans have always been an integral part of our workforce, bringing invaluable skills, leadership and experience
to our organization. Our dedication to supporting this community remains unwavering. We continue to focus on creating opportunities for veterans, providing them with access to meaningful professional development and resources to support their success.
In addition, we recognize the invaluable role of spouses and family members of veterans and active-duty personnel, who often bring their own experiences of resilience, adaptability and leadership, yet may not be counted in traditional self-identification metrics. By refining our veteran outreach efforts and enhancing recruitment strategies, we aim to attract and retain qualified people with military backgrounds.
Our commitment to inclusion and diversity helps us honor their service while strengthening the fabric of our organization.
The Skills First Apprenticeship program provides career opportunities for qualified individuals who have not obtained a traditional four-year degree. Serving over 155 apprentices to date, this program provides education, training and mentorship to develop expertise in key areas, offering a pathway to meaningful careers. As
the program evolves, we will introduce new training opportunities and explore the ways we can best connect apprentices with high-demand job roles, breaking down barriers and creating pathways to success.

 Employee Well-Being
We take a broad view of well-being anchored in providing support for mental and physical health, financial knowledge and security, as well as a culture of rich connections and purpose to inspire all employees to be their best. While the local environment shapes program offerings in each of our affiliate locations around the world, our well-being framework is global. A global steering team, sponsored by Lilly leadership, actively guides our well-being strategy.
 Pay and Benefits
Our pay and benefits programs are designed to attract and retain an inclusive and highly motivated workforce while reinforcing our care for employees and shared purpose to make life better. Lilly’s pay programs reward employee contributions and overall business success, and our benefit programs provide the flexibility to meet employees where they are in life and support overall well-being. We strive to deliver pay and benefits with
a global mindset, differentiating programs where local business needs or markets necessitate.
Health
Our ability to deliver for patients begins with the good health of our employees and those they go home to each day. Through our robust suite of benefits, we support employees whether they are seeking to stay well, get well, or manage a serious illness. From comprehensive health and well-being benefits, mental health programs and services, fitness and health coaching benefits,
to additional support such as onsite health clinics at various Lilly sites, we continuously strive to offer employees the health support they need.
Money
We understand the importance of taking care of one’s finances, whether an employee is just starting their career or on their way to retirement. Our base pay program is designed to help employees meet their day-to-day needs while our bonus and stock programs deliver additional rewards aligned with our company mission of delivering medicines to patients worldwide. To further unite and motivate our workforce, from 2022- 2024, we issued a special global stock grant known as Lilly Shares, giving all employees the opportunity to be shareholders in Lilly. In many countries, we also invest
in financial benefits - pensions and/or savings programs —to support our employees in their retirement years,

        Our Strategy
disability benefits for financial protection, life insurance for peace of mind and educational support for continued learning and development. Collectively, our pay, stock, and benefits programs support our employees in reaching their financial goals.
We are committed to pay equity for all employees. We conduct pay equity studies on our workforce globally and believe that pay equity is critical to our success in supporting a global and inclusive workforce.
Life
Life is filled with moments that matter, and we offer support to employees to help balance the personal and professional aspects of life. While our employee benefits programs vary around the world, these may include flexible work arrangements, onsite conveniences,
and time off to disconnect whether it's for vacation or in times of injury, illness or compassionate
care emergencies.
Our global recognition program allows teammates to recognize one another regardless of their work location through supervisor-to-employee, peer-to-peer and service-based recognition. Employees may congratulate coworkers’ successes through the companywide recognition feed, providing a consistent and meaningful recognition experience for all employees.
Learning and Development
We invest in employees’ growth by providing resources for career and leadership development. We want every individual at Lilly to reach their full potential, which is why we offer tools and resources to support them on their journey and help them contribute at their highest level to fulfill our company’s purpose.
Every employee has an individually tailored learning plan. We offer the specialized training our employees need
to do their jobs in the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry. We also provide training about corporate policies, such as those contained in our code of business conduct. And we work to nurture a culture of lifelong learning by encouraging employees to seek ongoing education and growth experiences to help them build rewarding careers.
Lilly’s work encompasses business areas and functions spanning discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing and global services. With broad technical and support functions, we offer employees opportunities
to grow, develop their careers and pursue internal positions across areas of interest and geographies. We offer internal learning and development programs and resources to help employees navigate these
Environmental Social Governance Transparency opportunities, identify career objectives and acquire the
right skills in a complex, dynamic environment.
These “upskilling” and “reskilling” offerings are often
a win-win for employees and the company: employees can pursue exciting new skills and opportunities, and the company benefits from retaining engaged employees who are already knowledgeable about Lilly and
our industry.
Continuing Education Support
Lilly supports employees' continuing education
through several programs. To facilitate participation, Lilly has transitioned the tuition assistance program from an employee reimbursement model to a pre-
pay model, removing the requirement for one year of service for eligibility. Academic coaching has also been implemented. These enhancements have led to more employees taking advantage of the benefits and pursuing further education, with the percentage of participating employees increasing year to year. Furthermore, Lilly provides training that meets the criteria for professional recertifications in various fields such as engineering
and accounting.

Employee Engagement
Our employee engagement survey, the Pulse survey, has been administered in some form since 1995. The Pulse survey, which is available in multiple languages, is sent to all eligible employees. In 2024 this was completed quarterly with 25% of employees invited at random each quarter to participate.
Pulse data is used to help track how different Lilly initiatives are progressing, measure the engagement
of Lilly employees, and inform changes that should
be made in business units to improve aspects like innovation and productivity. Over the past five years, our response rate averaged around 60%, with more than 27,000 employees responding to the survey in 2024.
Lilly's Pulse survey continues to be a valuable tool
in measuring employee engagement. The consistent performance with minimal decreases indicates a strong foundation of employee satisfaction and stability.
The 2024 survey results, showcasing a favorable Engagement score of 76% and a Team Lilly Include score of 76%, reflect the company's ongoing commitment to fostering a supportive and engaging work environment. These figures underscore the resilience and positive sentiment among Lilly employees, demonstrating that the organization is well-equipped to maintain its high level of engagement and inclusivity.
Annual employee Pulse survey scores are subject to potential inherent year-on-year fluctuations depending on updates made to underlying question design.
Environmental Social Governance Transparency Attrition Rate
Lilly’s total attrition rate for 2024 was 7%. The total attrition decreased from the previous year, and we have consistently remained below industry averages.
Employee Safety
Keeping our people safe and healthy, whether at home or at work, is a high priority and aligns directly with our values. We realize the journey toward excellence in safety never ends, and we are constantly evaluating approaches to improve our safety programs and integrate injury prevention into everyday work.
We focus on creating a companywide culture where best-in-class safety practices are consistently followed. To do this, we assess and continuously strive to improve our safety performance to promote the well-being of employees and to help safeguard the communities where we operate.
All employees are required to complete routine training on health, safety and environmental programs. This includes general health, safety and environmental training, as well as training on industry-specific and job-specific programs and procedures. Employees are also trained on relevant emergency preparedness and response procedures.
At Lilly, we measure both leading and lagging indicators when assessing our overall safety performance. We have found that tracking leading – or predictive – indicators, such as ergonomic risk, safety culture scores and precursors for life-altering and fatality risks, contributes greatly to our company's safety performance. Using these indicators in conjunction with lagging indicators, such as our injury rates, we can paint a comprehensive picture of the areas that most affect employee safety across Lilly. This approach allows us to both influence change where needed and track our safety progress in concrete ways over time.
Employee Safety Goals
We set challenging employee safety goals and monitor performance to ensure we are making improvements in the most impactful areas.
We strive to achieve zero severe injuries – with a focus on continuous improvement. In 2024, our severe injury rate was 0.60 injuries per 500 employees, which represents a decrease over the 2023 rate of 0.69.
We track and report injuries as required by local regulations (e.g., OSHA); however, for internally tracked injury metrics, we utilize the severe injury rate metric, which is based on the ASTM Standard for Reporting
   61 | 2024 Sustainability Report

        Our Strategy
Environmental Social Governance Transparency
 Injuries and Illnesses. This metric is applied globally and provides insights into our safety program performance. We also track the number of process safety deviations in our applicable sites and the number of life-altering injuries and fatalities globally.
Promoting a Culture of Safety at Lilly
Lilly has established safety metrics connected to
our safety priorities and improving safety culture.
Our priorities include developing safety leadership capabilities, reducing our most significant risks that could have life-altering or fatal consequences and managing business continuity risks, including those associated with process safety management. We know that to reach our goal for safety performance, Lilly must continue to instill and promote a best-in-class safety culture. We use a well-known model – the DSS+ Bradley CurveTM – to measure advancements in safety cultural maturity across the company. In addition, we evaluate and respond to the results from the safety leadership questions within our company’s employee Pulse surveys.
Ergonomics
We prioritize employee safety, whether working from the office, in the field or remotely. Our ergonomics program includes educational resources and equipment, connects employees to ergonomic experts and shares ergonomic success stories and best practices. Employees can complete an online assessment tool to learn how to reduce their ergonomic risk, and we provide remote employees with home office equipment and ergonomic accessories. Additionally, we continue to promote the use of a computer software that prompts employees to take pauses and safety breaks based on computer use and enables employees and their supervisors to monitor ergonomic risk level.
Life-Altering Injury and Fatality Elimination
We continue to advance safety efforts and continuous improvement initiatives at Lilly facilities, with a focus on addressing injuries at every level, including life-altering injuries and fatalities and our areas of highest risk (e.g., manufacturing operations and motor vehicle collisions).
We are proud of our progress to reduce injuries to employees and contractors, but we recognize that lower injury rates don’t necessarily correlate to fewer life-altering injuries and fatalities. Over the last several years, we have applied a concentrated focus on our Life-altering Injury and Fatality Elimination (LIFE)
program. LIFE near-miss events and key learnings are shared broadly through our HSE Alert process and data are used to identify and implement risk reductions across the organization. We regularly benchmark with peer companies to share events and new methods
for controlling LIFE risks and to continuously identify opportunities to improve safety.
Addressing Our Highest Risks
Consistent with the hierarchy of controls, significant effort has been made to expand on safety design criteria for new and existing Lilly facilities. To further minimize our highest risks, our manufacturing sites have continued to focus on implementation of advanced engineering and automation controls and process monitoring analytics for proactive event prevention. Near-miss data are collected and shared, and mitigation techniques are standardized where appropriate.
Managing Our Process Safety Risks
Some pharmaceutical manufacturing processes
use hazardous chemicals subject to process safety management standards established by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state agencies and EU directives and regulations. Over two decades ago, Lilly developed a globally integrated process safety management (GIPSM) program to manage process safety risks. Process safety management aspects
are integrated within product development and manufacturing processes utilizing hazard analysis and risk elimination, procedural and training requirements, change management oversight and many other controls designed to minimize the risk of a catastrophic event.
By maintaining a sustained focus on process safety programs and HSE improvements, we believe we have significantly reduced the risk posed by the most serious potential process safety-related events.
Affiliate Motor Vehicle Safety
Many of our affiliate employees (i.e., office and field- based roles) have jobs that require significant time driving to interface with customers, exposing them to risks of collisions and injuries.
We have an internal motor vehicle safety program including driver training, collision monitoring and analysis, and coaching support for high-risk drivers. Additionally, we focus on driving without distraction,
 62 | 2024 Sustainability Report

        Our Strategy
supervisor-led safety coaching, country-specific driver safety programs, and vehicle safety requirements.
Collectively, these efforts have contributed to a decrease in collisions and motor vehicle-related injuries over time.
Safe Use of Mobile Electronic Device While Driving Procedure
At Lilly, we believe that no one should ever be hurt doing their job. The use of mobile electronic devices while driving increases the potential for motor vehicle collision and personal injury. For this reason, all employees across the company are subject to a global procedure that prohibits, with limited exceptions for brief and urgent scenarios, the use of mobile electronic devices while driving any company-owned or leased vehicle, while conducting company business driving any vehicle, or while driving on company property.
Environmental Social Governance Transparency Contractor Safety
Our contractor safety management program starts
with the objective of compliance with all regulations
in the jurisdictions in which we work. However, our approach to safety goes beyond compliance with the belief that all accidents are preventable. We employ strict qualification criteria for contractors before they are awarded work and, once they are selected, we require ongoing job-specific training. Throughout all projects,
we stress that safety is the top priority, before cost and schedule. We emphasize job-specific task planning, continuous recognition of changing conditions and safety observation reporting.

This includes our concern for all who interact with Lilly – patients, customers, employees, shareholders, partners, suppliers and communities. Our purpose of making life better guides our efforts for employees, partners and suppliers to uphold our values and respect human rights as we work together to improve lives.
Integrating Respect for Human Rights
We strive to embed respect for human rights throughout our business activities and relationships. Lilly joined
the United Nations Global Compact in 2009 and is
committed to the UNGC’s Ten Principles on respecting internationally proclaimed human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. Each year we review and reaffirm our commitment to the 10 principles outlined by the UNGC and we provide an index of where to find information about our integration of the UNGC principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations.

Lilly fully supports standards, as reflected by the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate, that both adults and children should be free from compulsory or coerced labor, and that people should have the right to associate freely and bargain collectively.
Forced and Child Labor
Lilly maintains a longstanding practice of complying with local minimum age laws and requirements and does not employ child labor, or forced or compulsory labor, in any of its facilities globally.
Freedom of Association and Right to Collective Bargaining
Lilly recognizes the importance of freedom of association in the workplace and respects the right of our employees to join associations of their own choosing. We interact with works councils and unions in several countries,
and we support these bodies and work productively with them. The vast majority of our workers globally are not covered under traditional collective bargaining agreements.
In some countries where we operate, governments mandate working conditions such as salary increases, minimum wages, bonuses, number of weekly working hours, vacation time and overtime rates. These vary by country, and we follow these mandates wherever they apply.
Several of our affiliates have employee councils that meet regularly with management to discuss workforce- related issues that directly impact them, such as company policies and organizational changes. As laws and guidelines change wherever we operate, we will continue to work with employees, advocacy groups and governing bodies to maintain compliance and respect the right of free association.
Human Rights in Our
Supply Chain
Lilly also expects our suppliers to uphold Lilly values and standards as outlined in our Supplier Code of Business Conduct. Our global standards and procedures include specific language about human rights, including our expectation that our vendors abide by Lilly’s human rights standards. We rely on our suppliers and contract manufacturing operations to ensure the ongoing availability of our medicines. As our manufacturing base has grown, we’ve taken steps designed to reduce our exposure to risks inherent in managing a global supply chain. When it comes to quality and health, safety and environmental (HSE) risks in our supply chain, we have taken steps to educate and engage our suppliers directly on HSE issues and to help them build expertise around HSE topics. This includes our ongoing work as part of the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI), which helps outline what the pharmaceutical industry expects from its supply chain. Lilly was an inaugural member of PSCI, which created and maintains the Pharmaceutical Industry Principles for Responsible Supply Chain Management. These principles address five areas of supplier performance standards: ethics, labor, health and safety, environment and management systems. Lilly’s Supplier Code of Business Conduct reflects the PSCI principles. We require that our suppliers source materials responsibly and abstain from procuring materials from conflict areas or sources including the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Intellectual Property Principles for Advancing Cures and Therapies
Our scientists harness the power of biotechnology to advance new discoveries that have the potential to transform care, relieve suffering, and manage previously unmanageable conditions. Our ability to sustain investments to develop and deliver medicines depends upon an effective intellectual property (IP) system.
We recognize that responsible use of IP protections promotes progress for people, health care systems, and society.
Lilly is a participant in the IP PACT (IP Principles for Advancing Cures and Therapies), a multi-company initiative affirming the biopharmaceutical industry’s commitment to innovation and keeping patients at
the center of our work. The IP PACT includes ten principles guiding the way our industry uses IP, including to facilitate collaboration and partnerships, to act responsibly in patent proceedings, to support vibrant generic and biosimilar markets, and to approach IP in the world’s poorest countries in ways that take into account their unique socio-economic challenges. The principles are intended to balance the needs of patients, society, and our business — to further health care innovation and help patients live longer, and healthier lives.

Environmental Social Governance Transparency bioethics and research ethics questions. Learn more
about our approach to Bioethics. Clinical Trial Safety
One of the primary responsibilities of Lilly researchers and the medical professionals who conduct our clinical trials is the safety of study participants. Participant safety and well-being is monitored throughout each clinical trial. In addition, Ethics Review Boards, a team of people independent from the research, review every clinical trial to ensure appropriate steps are taken to protect the rights and welfare of participants before enrollment, and they maintain independent oversight over each clinical trial throughout its duration. Learn more in Patient Safety.
Lilly applies a single global standard to the conduct of medical trials involving human subjects. This standard is based on well-respected ethics guidance and other requirements. Learn more about our approach to continued access to investigational medicine and multinational clinical studies.
Clinical Trial Inclusion and Accessibility
Every time someone takes a medicine—even if it’s over the counter—they are benefiting from the results of a clinical trial, a scientific study where researchers apply rigorous testing to ensure the safety and effectiveness of a medicine.
Many factors impact how someone will respond to a treatment, including their genetic background, race and/ or ethnicity, gender, lifestyle and physical environment. To ensure that medicines are safe and effective for the patients who bear the burden of disease, it is critical
that the patient population in clinical trials reflect the prevalence of the disease in the community. At Lilly, delivering accessible community based clinical trials are a strategic business imperative that allows us to have greater impact in improving equitable health outcomes. Our approach to designing clinical trials is based on
the principles of answering the important questions of safety and efficacy as well as ensuring that the inclusion/ exclusion criteria enable the trial to enroll the intended study population.
         66 | 2024 Sustainability Report

        Our Strategy
Environmental Social Governance Transparency
 To increase trial accessibility to more patients, Lilly
has set clear and measurable goals to increase access for those most affected by the diseases we study. This approach allows us to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the safety and efficacy of the medicines we develop, ensuring they are effective for the patients who will use them. These goals include:
• Strategically designing trials to enroll participants who match the prevalence of the disease in
the community.
• Intentionally selecting a range of investigators in regions with high disease prevalence where studies are being conducted.
• Tailoring reach through elevating the patient's voice, education activities, partnerships and collaboration.
Access to Medicine
We are committed to equitable and affordable access to our medicines so that our breakthroughs can transform more people’s lives. We’re also committed to expanding our impact on society by addressing complex global health challenges, with a focus on people living in communities with limited resources.
Learn more about Lilly’s extensive efforts in both U.S. Access & Affordability and Global Access & Health.
Protecting People’s Privacy
Lilly believes in the ethical management of personal information whether it is that of a customer, an employee or any other individual. Our privacy program reflects our commitment to being open and honest about how we collect, manage, use and disclose personal information, and we’re intentional about protecting it. We take reasonable precautions to protect personal information against loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.
Learn more about how Lilly respects privacy. Speaking Up
Lilly policy encourages our employees and our suppliers to report known or suspected issues, concerns or behavior that could harm Lilly or those we serve. We foster a culture where all individuals are empowered
to speak up and engage with management to identify and implement appropriate continuous improvement. We recognize that speaking up, even if anonymously,
is our right and our responsibility, and that taking no action when action is warranted can have serious consequences. We encourage employees and suppliers to share concerns openly and honestly – including on issues of human rights – knowing that Lilly will not tolerate acts of retaliation for reporting inappropriate conduct, preventing unlawful practices or participating in an investigation.

Thus, including a diverse group of participants in our clinical trials is essential. Learn more about how we approach diversity in our trials.
One of the primary responsibilities of Lilly researchers and the medical professionals who conduct our clinical trials is the safety of study participants. Participant safety and well-being are monitored throughout
each clinical trial. Ethics review boards, along with independent research teams, are responsible for safeguarding the rights and welfare of clinical trial participants prior to their enrollment as well as ongoing oversight over each clinical trial throughout its duration.
Before enrolling in a clinical trial, participants are given information about the study through a process called informed consent, which continues throughout the duration of the study. This document describes the
study’s purpose, length, procedures, risks and benefits, and other information that all participants should know. Participants may withdraw from a study at any time
for any reason. They are also informed if new safety information emerges during the study that may influence their decision to continue participation.
Lilly sponsors clinical trials and relies on various partners to conduct them. In addition to the medical professionals at research sites, known as clinical trial investigators, we collaborate with service providers, technology providers, research monitors, and other necessary entities to effectively carry out our research. These partnerships are crucial for ensuring appropriate oversight. For example, research monitors collaborate with investigator sites to validate and confirm clinical trial data, while technology providers supply items such as electronic trial diaries or digital devices to collect biomarker data (e.g., pulse, breathing rate, body temperature). We conduct robust evaluations of these partners to ensure they meet Lilly standards for research and data privacy, and we oversee their activities throughout the clinical trial to ensure quality and data integrity.
During the clinical trial, researchers monitor patient safety by collecting any information on adverse events that occur to identify potential safety concerns. Lilly reviews these adverse events across trial participants to help inform researchers, participants and regulators how to appropriately manage the care of the research volunteers, and to inform the benefit-risk profile of our products in development.
Upholding Product Quality
Lilly is deeply committed to manufacturing high-quality medicines and ensuring product safety. We take our obligations seriously and have rigorous quality systems in place to ensure compliance
with regulatory requirements.
Our Global Quality team ensures independence and objectivity by reporting directly to our CEO. The team is involved throughout the product life cycle, working across all phases of drug development
and manufacturing, providing guidance and quality oversight, and collaborating with colleagues in research and development and manufacturing to comply with regulatory and internal standards.
Global Quality is responsible for managing and updating the Lilly Quality System, which is an integrated framework of standards, business processes, organizational controls, and oversight designed to help ensure that high-quality medicines are delivered to patients. This system, which also includes U.S. sales

and marketing standards, supports delivering balanced, objective, substantiated and current information to our customers. It supports and reinforces the Lilly values and our commitment to operating ethically
and responsibly.
Environmental Social Governance Transparency Global Quality also oversees the following activities to
safeguard product quality:
• Testing and Assurance Checks – Testing and assurance checks are performed throughout the manufacturing process, starting with testing raw materials and components, continuing through in-process testing of active pharmaceutical ingredients, and finally, testing final products to confirm compliance with regulatory and internal specifications.
Authorization and Regulation of Products – The Lilly Regulatory Affairs organization is responsible
for the content of product submissions and any communications related to submission review and approval. They also manage post-approval product registrations, labeling, promotional materials and associated regulatory policies.
 In addition, Lilly emphasizes the culture of quality and
has adapted a culture-focused program. Aspects of
the program include leadership training and employee engagement. Lilly performs quality culture assessments
of the manufacturing sites to reinforce cultural strengths
and operational excellence. We work to create an • environment where employees are empowered to speak
up and share concerns. Learn more in our Business Ethics section.
Lilly hosts regular inspections by global regulatory bodies at manufacturing facilities, marketing affiliates and clinical areas. These inspections ensure adherence to regulations such as Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and quality standards. The successful outcome of these inspections supports continued reliable supply to patients while driving continuous improvement to meet regulatory expectations based on learnings from these inspections.
Lilly has a thorough process to assess potential quality defects and safety issues from internal testing, an event that potentially impacts product, quality or a complaint. Incidents posing patient risk are escalated, promptly investigated and triaged by technical subject matter experts, quality management, and safety physicians. Investigation outcomes are used for continuous process improvement.
If a market action, such as a product recall, is necessary, Lilly executes an established process with agreement from respective health authorities to promptly and efficiently remove affected material and communicate the decision to minimize the risk to patients. In some cases, incidents of suspected or confirmed counterfeit Lilly products within the legitimate supply chain can prompt a recall of authentic Lilly products. In these circumstances, the authentic Lilly product does not pose a risk. Lilly collaborates with health authorities and law enforcement agencies to determine if a recall of the material is needed to prevent counterfeit medicine from harming patients and to ensure the integrity of the legitimate supply chain.

Management Approach
At Lilly, we are committed to upholding high standards of corporate conduct in our business dealings around the world. Our code of business conduct and our policies, compliance management systems, human resource performance and promotion systems, training programs and communications initiatives are designed to work together to reinforce a culture of integrity and ethical behavior.
As part of our commitment to operating ethically
and responsibly, we continue to improve our ethics
and compliance program. The program is designed to promote ethical conduct and instill a culture of integrity. Lilly’s ethics and compliance function support our global anti-corruption, enterprise risk management, integrated

risk management and business continuity efforts.
These programs feature board-level and management oversight, written standards, training, communication, proactive risk assessments, processes for reporting concerns, internal investigations, auditing, and proactive monitoring designed to reduce risk, enhance proactive compliance, and prevent fraud and other regulatory or policy violations.
A key component of our culture of ethics and integrity is transparency about how we work. Lilly collaborates with health care professionals and organizations focused on improving the health and quality of patients’ lives. We believe being transparent about our relationships with these external groups, advocacy organizations, and other stakeholders helps Lilly build trust and respect for how we work with others to benefit the people we serve.
   72 | 2024 Sustainability Report

        Ethics and Compliance
We assess risks in our business functions and regions
to help leaders understand, prioritize and mitigate ethics, compliance and fraud risks. We have a robust investigation process and develop corrective and preventive action plans as appropriate. We also use data to improve our programs and assist leaders in assessing their risks.
Lilly’s chief ethics and compliance officer is responsible for developing and operating our ethics and compliance program. This includes reporting obligations to the CEO and regular updates to the Ethics and Compliance Committee and Audit Committee of the Board
of Directors.
Integrated Risk Management
The Board reviews the company’s prioritized enterprise risks, appropriate mitigation plans and the company’s overall state of compliance. To provide a comprehensive review, the overall state of compliance report blends key information from various groups within Lilly, including corporate audit services, ethics and compliance, health, safety, environment and global quality.
Our Code of Conduct, Policies and Procedures
Our code of business conduct, policies and procedures are designed to reinforce our core values and provide guidance on how we expect business to be conducted. They include processes for interacting with health care providers, government officials and others, and they are designed to be consistent with codes issued by other relevant organizations, including the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA), the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry Associations (EFPIA), and the Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (JPMA).
Our global procedures and processes support the ethical marketing and promotion of our products and require the review and approval of this content by relevant subject matter experts. We investigate potential violations of these procedures and, as warranted, take corrective
and preventive actions including reporting to regulatory authorities as appropriate.
In 2024, we received no warning letters or untitled letters from the Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP), U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) or the Advertising and Promotional Labeling Branch (APLB) and U.S. FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation
and Research. Lilly applied the learnings from previous untitled letters to its review processes for future communications involving all marketed products.
We regularly update and disseminate our compliance- related expectations through The Red Book, our code of business conduct. Available in 20 languages, this document and associated trainings are designed to support a judgment-based approach emphasizing
the company’s values and the importance of ethical decision-making. The code of business conduct and associated training includes our 12 corporate policies:
• Our Ethical Foundation
• Conducting Research and Development
• Respecting People
• Assuring Quality
• Ethical Interactions: Communicating Honestly
• Ethical Interactions: Preventing Corruption
• Maintaining Financial Integrity
• Respecting Personal Information and Privacy
• Using Artificial Intelligence Responsibly
• Managing and Protecting Information
• Protecting People, the Environment and Our Assets • Speaking Up: No Retaliation
Ethics Training and Communications
We recognize the impact of people and the role of
human behavior on our organization’s culture, and we aim to integrate these elements into our ethics and compliance program as part of our strategy to promote ethical behavior and decision-making. We believe all employees can play a role in the success of our ethics and compliance program, so we consider training and communications to be essential components of nurturing a culture of integrity and ethics throughout our business.
Training and Development
Each year, we require our employees to complete training in ethical business practices. This includes requiring all Lilly employees and key contractors to complete training on The Red Book and certify they have read, understood and will abide by its requirements. 100% of employees assigned training during the annual global retraining period in 2024 completed this annual training prior to the internal due date.
Our Strategy
Environmental Social Governance Transparency
   73 | 2024 Sustainability Report

        Most employees also receive additional targeted ethics and compliance training related to their specific role. Employees who do not complete required ethics and compliance training receive HR discipline, as appropriate.
As part of our focus on nurturing a culture of integrity, we supplement our ethics and compliance training
with case studies. Our goal is to help our leaders and employees understand the role pressure can play in rationalizing poor decisions and techniques they can use to mitigate this risk for themselves and within their teams. Additionally, we share details of real situations to reinforce with employees the behaviors and best practices that have led to ethical decision-making, as well as the lessons learned from past missteps. We want to help employees apply our principles, policies and procedures in their day-to-day work.
In addition to having core ethics and compliance subject matter experts as part of the ethics and compliance function, we also regularly provide high-potential employees with development assignments within
the ethics and compliance function. We gain valuable insights from these participants, and we believe they return to their roles in the business with a renewed understanding of our commitment to integrity and the programs in place to support it.
Communications
We strengthen our culture through robust
communications to help ensure employees are aware
of their responsibilities under our policies, know where
to find resources and understand lessons we have
learned as an organization. Leaders are provided with
resources designed to help them recognize their vital
role in creating an environment that encourages ethical behavior. We publish articles on our internal website to communicate and support our commitment to integrity • and ethical decision-making.
days a week and is available online to employees
and the public globally (subject to local law). The hotline website also lists up-to-date local toll-free phone numbers for most countries, where available. Translation services are available, if needed, and reports may be made anonymously (subject to
local law). In addition, employees or the public may submit reports of misconduct, inquiries or other allegations to Lilly via email. Employees are actively encouraged to bring concerns to supervisors, leaders and representatives of ethics and compliance, legal and human resources. As our Speaking Up: No Retaliation policy states: “We share concerns openly and honestly, knowing that Lilly will not tolerate acts of retaliation.”
Monitoring – We maintain a risk-based ethics and compliance monitoring program. Key components
of the program include a global monitoring strategy, risk assessments, monitoring plans and standardized tools and processes for reporting metrics to our business and functional leaders. We are increasingly utilizing data and analytics to detect risks as a core element of our monitoring program.
We have worked to build and nurture a culture where people notice and speak up about mistakes or concerns, ask questions when they don’t know the right course
of action to take and listen when someone raises a concern or question. Our “Speaking Up: No Retaliation” policy supports this mindset, and we've created a comprehensive set of resources to help employees understand how we define retaliation, why we do not tolerate it in any form and the channels available to support speaking up.
Tracking Our Progress
We track our progress in many ways, including reviewing the results of our annual employee surveys. Results from the 2024 surveys show that approximately
• Corporate Auditing – Our internal corporate auditing functions conduct financial, nonfinancial and quality audits of Lilly affiliates, functions, manufacturing, research and certain third parties to evaluate compliance with our policies and procedures.
Audits are determined based on prioritization of
the risk landscape using a risk-based methodology, leveraging data analytics, and are influenced by the results of the annual Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process aligned with the company’s strategic

Our Strategy
Environmental Social Governance Transparency
 95% of survey respondents say they would report a suspected ethical violation if observed, and 95% know how to access the proper channels to report a potential violation.
Reporting, Monitoring and Auditing
To help identify possible compliance issues, we maintain an internal disclosure system that includes a mechanism for anonymous reporting (where permitted by local law). We also review business actions through a system of monitoring and audits:
• Internal Reporting – Lilly employees are required to report known or suspected violations of the law, The Red Book, company policies or official orders
or decrees applicable to our business. We recognize speaking up is our right and responsibility, and we encourage employees to report any ethical concerns or issues, including harassment and discrimination. The Lilly Ethics and Compliance Hotline is staffed by an independent firm, 24 hours a day, seven

 plan. Audits include reviews of our anti-corruption program, privacy and other policies related to ethical interactions (e.g., off-label promotion).
• Assurance Governance – To effectively align and integrate our companywide audit, assessment and monitoring activities to provide a focus on enterprise risks, we operate an Assurance Governance Forum. The forum is comprised of leadership from multiple assurance functions including ethics and compliance, audit, quality and information security. This objective is to provide integrated leadership to ensure that our risk and compliance programs meet the expectations of stakeholders and that our programs are integrated across the company to deliver maximum value and efficiency. The forum shares its learnings and insights with senior leadership and the Board of Directors.
Investigations and Corrective Actions
We take seriously reports of known or suspected violations of company policies and procedures, and
we investigate claims of potential wrongdoing that
are brought to our attention. We seek to identify and address inappropriate conduct as early as possible and to prevent future recurrences. Our global investigation team receives specialized training and conducts investigations according to a standardized process designed to satisfy applicable global and local procedural and privacy requirements.
Listed below are statistics on high-risk allegations brought to our attention in 2024 and evaluated through a consistent process. These statistics concern allegations determined to be of the highest risk to the company and include potential violations of policies and procedures related to finance, sales, marketing, manufacturing, quality and conduct.
In 2024, we investigated and closed 348 high-risk allegations*, and confirmed that a violation had occurred 80% of the time. Outcomes related to violations are listed below:
• Individuals disciplined, up to and including termination – 51%
• Individuals received corrective feedback or other outcome – 49%
*One allegation equals one individual. If a situation involves more than one individual, that matter may be recorded as multiple allegations. High-risk allegations may include some third- party cases and violations. Statistics calculated as of April 2025.
During investigations of high-risk matters, our team works to identify root causes. Following an investigation, we help business area owners identify and implement corrective and preventive actions designed to address the issue, as well as prevent a recurrence. We monitor the effectiveness of these actions, adjust as needed and track and report our progress
Anti-Corruption
Compliance
Lilly’s commitment to operating with high ethical standards includes complying with applicable Anti- Bribery and Anti-Corruption (ABAC) laws and regulations, and it extends to business relationships, dealings and activities all over the world. Our global policies prohibit bribery, fraud and other acts of dishonesty, including that we do not offer, provide, authorize or accept anything of value – or give the appearance that we do – to inappropriately influence a decision or gain an unfair advantage. This also extends to our work with third parties. We use a risk-based anti-corruption due diligence process to evaluate certain third parties, as appropriate, before engaging them, including the following:
• Third parties who may be authorized by Lilly to interact with health care providers or government officials on the company’s behalf
• Prospective recipients of grants and donations • Prospective business development partners.
When appropriate, as determined through our risk evaluation process, third parties are required to follow anti-corruption policy and procedure requirements and participate in anti-corruption training. As part of our ongoing monitoring efforts, we conduct independent ABAC assessments of certain third parties, which often include site visits and transaction testing. We also conduct an annual global anti-corruption risk assessment to identify potential risks and develop appropriate risk mitigation plans.
In addition, employees who are in positions most likely to interact with third parties are required to complete additional scenario-based training above and beyond our annual code of business conduct training. This training, which includes anti-corruption training, is designed to reinforce our policies, procedures and processes that promote ethical interactions. In 2024, 100% of required employees completed this additional training prior to the internal due date. Employees who do not complete required ethics and compliance training receive HR discipline, as appropriate.

        Respecting Privacy
Privacy is a top priority for Lilly, as reflected by our longstanding global privacy program. At its core, our privacy program reflects our commitment to being open and honest about how we collect, manage, use and disclose personal information. We are intentional about protecting personal information and strive to
use the minimum amount necessary to do our work.
We share personal information only with those who are authorized and have a legitimate business need to see it, and we insist our suppliers and third parties handle personal information in accordance with core privacy expectations, as well as applicable laws and regulations.
At Lilly, we expect our employees, suppliers and anyone working on our behalf to work responsibly and protect the personal information that is entrusted to us. These expectations are stated in our global Respecting Personal Information and Privacy policy, as well as our Respecting Privacy procedure, and are emphasized
in enterprise-wide training on the responsible use of personal information.
Governance of Privacy
The Digital Sustainability team within the Legal department oversees the privacy program for our operations around the world and is led by our chief privacy officer, working with a team of global and
local privacy experts. As the volume of data grows exponentially and as comprehensive data privacy
laws proliferate in the U.S. and worldwide, privacy is a board-level priority. In addition to running its standard risk assessment process, the privacy team is actively engaged with relevant external constituents to stay abreast of new privacy laws, related risks and potential impacts of noncompliance, as appropriate, and to
inform leadership of such developments as warranted. The privacy team also shares developing privacy requirements and identifies key privacy risks to our broader ethics and compliance organization, as well as to other key internal stakeholders, including our corporate audit team partners.
Bioethics
Our investment in bioethics capabilities reflects our company values and purpose to improve people’s lives and communities around the world. We were one of the first pharmaceutical companies to establish
a standing Bioethics Advisory committee in 1999.
Our bioethics program is designed to address the increasingly complex and fast-paced ethical challenges of global pharmaceutical research, development and commercialization. Our focus is to protect and advocate for the rights and well-being of research participants and

Our Strategy
Environmental Social Governance Transparency patients, as well as the integrity of the scientific process
and its applications for health care.
Our bioethics program provides Lilly employees with resources including the Lilly Bioethics Framework
for Human Biomedical Research, position papers on major bioethical issues, and bioethics consultation and education. Additionally, our staff and the Bioethics Advisory Committee provide input into policy decisions that have bioethical implications, and we collaborate externally to establish best practices in applying bioethics across the industry.
Bioethics Advisory Committee
Our bioethics program reports to the chief medical officer. The Bioethics Advisory Committee is made up of cross-functional experts and serves as a resource for Lilly employees to seek guidance on bioethics considerations, discuss potential courses of action, and receive advice on potential paths forward.
We apply the principles in the Lilly Bioethics Framework to our research study design, informed consent processes and content, selection of countries for
clinical trial sites, requests for access to investigational treatments outside of clinical trials, animal care and use, engagement of special populations (e.g., pediatrics), and timing and content of research publications.
Bioethics Program
Our bioethics program focuses on resource development and communication, consultations, and collaboration. We develop position papers on bioethics topics, provide consultations for employees seeking advice regarding bioethics and research ethics issues, and provide bioethics input to internal and external working groups.
Our Bioethics Framework for Human Biomedical Research and our Principles of Medical Research provide a bioethics foundation for the company’s positions on bioethics issues, promoting alignment with broadly accepted ethics principles and Lilly’s core values
of integrity, excellence, and respect for people. Our bioethics program aims to work with other companies
to establish best practices and to bring an industry perspective to bioethics discussions.
Our bioethics program advocates for the rights and well-being of research subjects and patients who use our medicines. Lilly applies a single global standard to the conduct of medical trials involving human subjects. This standard is based on well-respected ethics guidance and other requirements including:
   
        Our Strategy

 • The World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki
• The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences’ International Ethical Guidelines for Health-Related Research Involving Humans
• The International Conference on Harmonisation’s Guideline for Good Clinical Practice
• The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Principles on Conduct of Clinical Trials
• Applicable laws and regulations of the country or countries in which a study is conducted.
Transparency, Disclosure
and Political Engagement
We support various transparency initiatives globally, provided:
• That they are respectful of local laws related to intellectual property, trade secrets, competition and privacy
• The disclosure of information does not undermine our ability to compete effectively
• That information is communicated with appropriate context in an easily understood manner.
We seek to collaborate with policy makers, industry colleagues and key stakeholders to align on approaches that achieve these objectives.
Clinical Trials Data Transparency
Lilly is committed to the transparency of our clinical studies, and we recognize that responsible sharing of clinical study data can enhance public health. Since 2014, Lilly has enhanced our transparency initiatives in alignment with the PhRMA/EFPIA Principles for Responsible Clinical Trial Data Sharing. Lilly registers
and posts results of clinical trials on clinicaltrials.gov in addition to any legally required clinical trial registries. For Phase 2 and 3 trials that completed after 2019, Lilly submits results to clinicaltrials.gov one year after the completion of the trial regardless of the medicine’s approval status.
Lilly makes anonymized patient-level data available from Lilly-sponsored trials on marketed drugs for approved uses following acceptance for publication. Lilly is one
of several companies that provide this access through
a third-party website where qualified researchers can submit research proposals and request anonymized data to test new hypotheses.
In 2013, Lilly began conducting pilot projects creating summaries of Phase 2 and 3 clinical trial results in patient-friendly language using simple, everyday terms. Since 2021, Lilly has created plain language summaries of Phase 2-4 clinical trial results in English. Lilly expanded the scope of plain language summaries to include Phase 1 trials conducted in the EU to meet the EU Clinical Trial Regulation that went into full effect in 2023. Lilly posts plain language summaries for trials completed after 2023 to trialsummaries.com.

 HSE Management Systems
At Lilly, business areas including manufacturing, research and development, sales and marketing affiliate locations, and general administrative functions, are required to operate with an HSE management system that adheres to the Lilly HSE Standards. Lilly’s HSE Management System is consistent with third-party standards such as the International Organization
for Standardization (ISO) 14001, ISO 45001 and
the American Chemistry Council’s Responsible Care Management System (RCMS®) standards.
All employees are subject to recurring training on health, safety and environmental programs. This includes general health, safety and environmental training, as well as training on industry-specific and job-specific programs and procedures. Employees are also trained in relevant emergency preparedness and response procedures.
HSE Audits
We conduct HSE audits of Lilly sites and functional areas for each of our Global HSE Standards as well as regulatory requirements. Our multiyear audit plan is updated annually and identifies which areas to audit each year based on risk, with areas associated with high- risk operations being audited at least every three years. Audit results are shared with executive leadership and the Board of Directors, and management must respond to and address all audit observations and track progress against action plans.

SASB Disclosures Covered:
Supply Chain Management (HC-BP-430a.1) Management Approach
Ensuring our high-quality medicines are available wherever and whenever patients need them is one of our top priorities. We are committed to maintaining the safety and integrity of our medicines, which begins with the procurement of materials and extends throughout the production process. Through integration of Lilly- owned facilities and external suppliers, we aim to manufacture our medicines in an efficient, effective and safe manner. The Lilly Quality System supports this integration and is the foundation for our quality standards and processes throughout the product development life cycle, including auditing and assessing third-party risk.
In addition to our efforts internally, we promote strong health, safety and environmental (HSE) practices with our suppliers and contract manufacturing operations (CMOs). We work to mitigate counterfeit medicines and illegal compounding to protect patient safety. We also comply with governmental efforts around conflict minerals (see more on conflict minerals below).
A significant portion of Lilly's environmental and social impact is embedded in our supply chain. We are committed to supporting our suppliers and CMOs as they work to continuously improve their operations.
We believe that doing business with a varied set of suppliers also helps Lilly accelerate innovation and deliver strong results. We seek out fresh perspectives and insights by engaging minority group-owned, women- owned and small businesses.
Supply Chain Governance
Our supply chain augments our operations and we strive to instill our company’s operating principles within
our supplier network. We support the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) principles, adhere to human rights and labor laws, comply with anti-corruption practices, endeavor for a diverse supplier base and promote sustainability efforts designed to minimize our environmental footprint.
Lilly utilizes a risk-based approach designed to prevent product shortage so that patients have access to the right medicine at the right time. To help maintain a reliable supply of medicines, Lilly is expanding its manufacturing capacity, including new facilities in United States, Ireland and Germany.
We rely on our suppliers and CMOs, including those that supply us with research and development materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and final
drug products, to provide the ongoing availability of our medicines. As our manufacturing base has grown, we’ve taken significant steps designed to reduce our exposure to risks inherent in managing a global supply chain.
We continue to strengthen efforts to monitor our supply chain for quality and HSE events and risks. We have additional procedures for monitoring suppliers that may pose higher risks, and we intervene quickly when appropriate. Both quality and HSE considerations are integrated into Lilly’s process for evaluating potential new contract manufacturers, and formal assessments are conducted routinely (approximately every three years) for existing contract manufacturers.

        Our Strategy
Environmental Social Governance Transparency
 We have also taken steps to educate and engage our suppliers directly on HSE issues and to help them build expertise around HSE topics. This includes our ongoing work as part of the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI), a non-profit business membership organization founded in 2006. PSCI, along with
its member companies, created and maintains the
We expect our suppliers to conduct their own due diligence regarding the source of any materials they provide to us.
We seek to understand the origin of these materials and to avoid the inadvertent support of businesses associated with human rights violations.
Third Party
Risk Management
We engage with third parties to provide differentiated services, enable our focus on our core competencies and gain operating efficiencies. Working with third parties may increase potential risks such as service disruptions, data and security breaches, reputational harm, penalties and fines. Mitigating potential risks and protecting Lilly’s reputation is a companywide responsibility that includes third party participation.
With leadership from an internal center of excellence, we have established a third party risk management program focused on identifying and managing potential risks posed to the organization by working with third parties. Lilly’s program has five foundational operating model components: governance and delivery, policies and standards, management processes, tools and technology, and risk metrics and reporting.
The third party risk management program focuses on the following risk areas: anti-corruption, information security, privacy, information systems quality, customer information quality, animal welfare, business continuity and financial due diligence. Additional risk areas are expected to be phased in as the program evolves. The third party risk management program covers the full third party risk management lifecycle including due diligence activities that are conducted pre-contract and ongoing monitoring activities that are conducted post- contract through the life of the engagement.
Assessing & Auditing Third Party Operations
To meet the expectations of the Lilly quality system,
our Global Quality Auditing and Compliance team conducts risk-based audits to oversee both internal Lilly manufacturing sites and external third-party operations. We regularly assess the results of these assessments to inform audit plans and identify areas for improvement.
Lilly manufacturing sites conduct internal risk assessments of purchased material (raw materials, APIs, intermediates, packaging materials, and GMP consumables) based on quality standards. The risk assessments evaluate the supplier, complexity of the supply chain and how the material will be used at our
  Pharmaceutical Industry Principles for Responsible Supply Chain Management (the PSCI Principles).
The PSCI Principles provide our industry with consistent supplier performance standards in the
areas of ethics, labor, health and safety, the environment and related management systems. At Lilly, we have aligned several codes, policies and procedures with the PSCI Principles, including:
• Internal product stewardship requirements that detail our approach to managing risk across the supply chain
• The Lilly Supplier Code of Business Conduct, which applies to all suppliers
• Relevant procurement standards
• Standard contract language applicable to providers
of contract manufacturing services. Learn more about our HSE governance.
Conflict Minerals
We are concerned with human rights violations that occur throughout the world. This includes the ongoing conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and surrounding countries which is understood to be financed in part by the mining and trade of certain minerals, including tungsten, tantalum, tin and gold. We are committed to assessing our supply chain and the potential upstream impacts of our supply and purchasing decisions as they relate to the minerals
at issue.
Lilly filed annual reports for 2014 to 2024 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating
to the conflict minerals rule. As a part of this reporting process, we examine the raw material content of all our global commercial products and seek to identify their origin and source. Our goal is to develop a better understanding of our supply chain and avoid the inadvertent support of businesses associated with human rights violations.
Our expectation is that our suppliers source their materials responsibly and abstain from procuring materials from areas or sources that might promote conflict in the DRC.
     83 | 2024 Sustainability Report

        internal sites to determine an overall risk classification. The overall risk classification helps inform the actions needed to approve a new supplier, and the ongoing requirements to manage the supplier. Lilly oversees contract manufacturers’ conformance with regulatory requirements and quality expectations, including performing quality audits as needed.
For managing HSE risks, our manufacturing procurement contracts ask suppliers to support the PSCI Principles for Responsible Supply Chain Management, which set out the relevant practices any business operating within the pharmaceutical supply chain is expected to uphold
in the areas of ethics, human rights and labor, health and safety, environment and management systems. Lilly also expects our suppliers to conform to the HSE expectations outlined in our Lilly Supplier Code of Business Conduct. Standard contract language also requires that manufacturing suppliers, if requested by Lilly, agree to submit to audits that assess compliance with our expectations. Additionally, we engage with key suppliers on environmental sustainability topics such as climate change (greenhouse gas emissions), waste reduction and other relevant opportunities to minimize the environmental footprint of our supply chain.
Partnerships and Leadership
We are an active member of external associations
and consortiums aimed at enhancing the security, quality and safety of pharmaceutical supply chains. Team members of Lilly’s global quality auditing and compliance group actively participate in Rx-360 and International Pharmaceutical Excipients Council (IPEC) working groups to provide input into industry guidelines and standards and align our processes with our peers.
We currently hold a seat on the board of directors at Rx-360 and participate in several of the consortium’s working sub-groups to help ensure we stay informed of and help set industry best practices. During 2024, we are continuing the use of Rx-360 Supplier Audit Reports to supplement our internal audit plan as needed.
have historically been underrepresented in corporate purchasing. The programs we have created help us deliver on our purpose while also helping improve the economic opportunities of these suppliers.
The impact of our supplier development efforts supports job creation throughout the supply chain and in local communities.
Given the importance of advancing supplier development, we have developed a comprehensive strategy focusing on three key areas:
• Engage small businesses, and socially and/or economically disadvantaged (“Disadvantaged”) suppliers, advocacy organizations and industry partners to ensure an inclusive pool of potential suppliers
• Empower small businesses and Disadvantaged suppliers to access economic opportunities
• Positively impact the community where we live and operate through education, mentorship and opportunity.
We continued to mentor small and Disadvantaged
suppliers by expanding support programs with the
aim of helping these suppliers build stronger business
practices. We hosted multiple virtual and in-person

In 2024, we spent approximately $1.3 billion with over 1,300 suppliers classified as small businesses as defined by the U.S. Small Business Administration’s (SBA) small business size standards. During its most recent audit in 2016, the U.S. Small Business Administration recognized Lilly’s efforts to promote and maintain supplier inclusion as “outstanding” – the highest possible rating.
We again offered the Lilly Mentor Protégé program by mentoring eleven small businesses through an eight- month structured development program. The objective of the program is to develop small businesses by sharing Lilly methodologies and industry best practices to increase the proteges’ readiness for future business opportunities. Through this program, the supplier builds its network and capabilities for working with Lilly and more broadly with other customers.
Externally, we continued to provide strategic leadership influence by serving on various boards and committees with several advocacy organizations, including being a leader on the Business Equity for Indiana – Procurement Roundtable, which is advocating for and advancing local, small and/or Disadvantaged suppliers.

About Our Sustainability Report
Time period.
This report represents our sustainability performance for 2024. Data and other updates contained in this digital report are focused on the 2024 calendar year and include our global operations, unless otherwise noted. We also discuss data and trends from previous years where relevant.
Scope.
This report does not include joint ventures, partially owned subsidiaries or outsourced operations. This report references the Eli Lilly and Company Foundation, commonly referred to as the Lilly Foundation. The
Lilly Foundation, which was established in 1968 and
is supported by donations from Eli Lilly and Company, is a separate US tax-exempt private foundation that provides support to eligible US organizations consistent with Lilly Foundation’s philanthropic priorities.
This report may also reference other tax-exempt organizations, including the Lilly Cares Foundation, a separate US charitable organization that offers the Lilly Cares Foundation Patient Assistance Program, which helps qualified people in need receive donated Lilly medicines at no cost. Eligibility for the support provided by any tax-exempt organization is determined by such tax-exempt organization.
Data Measurement and Uncertainty.
Lilly and its affiliates provide medicines to separate charitable organizations that offer free Lilly medicines to qualifying patients. Throughout this report, such products are valued at wholesale acquisition costs.
Lilly follows structured processes to collect, evaluate, calculate and validate the data included in this report. We consider external standards in deciding what data to collect and report. The data presented in this report are collected using various methodologies, which in some instances are based on assumptions and estimates in which there are inherent uncertainties and limitations. For example, information may come from third-party sources and operations outside of our control. While
we believe such information is reasonably accurate and is based on reasonable principles and methodology, the third-party collection and validation of this data is
beyond our direct control. In addition, the achievement of certain sustainability goals and targets may be dependent on the actions of our partners, suppliers and other third parties, all of which are outside of
our control.
Furthermore, environmental data in this report is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data. The precision of different measurement techniques may vary.
As we improve our methodologies and as new information becomes available, we may continue to revise our estimates and assumptions. Methodology changes may include, without limitation, changes in a calculation, improvements in the quality of data, greater data granularity or updates to available third-party- reported data. Such updates may result in material changes to our calculations and may also result in adjustments made to the current and previous periods.
Referenced Frameworks.
Our global health, safety and the environment (HSE) management system is consistent with third-party standards such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) ISO 14001, ISO 45001 and the American Chemistry Council’s Responsible Care® Management System standards.
We use several external guidelines and measurement frameworks to inform the scope of our reporting. Applicable portions of this report have been prepared
in alignment with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) framework for Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals and informed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Reporting indices and sustainability data are available in the Transparency section.
Trademarks and Trade Names.
Trademarks or trade names referred to in this report are the property of Lilly, or, to the extent trademarks or trade names belonging to other companies are referenced
in this report, the property of their respective owners. Solely for convenience, the trademarks and trade names in this report may be referred to without the ® and TM

a characterization regarding the materiality of such information to our financial results, our operations or our stakeholders. While certain matters discussed in this report may be referred to as “significant” or “material,” any such significance or materiality should not be read as necessarily rising to the level of materiality used for the purposes of complying with U.S. securities laws, European Union sustainability reporting directives or regulations or under similar laws in other jurisdictions, even if we use the word “significant,” “material,” or “materiality” in this report.
This report includes statements regarding various policies, values, standards, approaches, procedures, processes, systems, programs, initiatives, assessments, technologies, practices and similar measures related to our operations (“Policies and Procedures”).

and Procedures will apply in every case. Such Policies and Procedures are subject to risks, uncertainties and
other factors, some of which are beyond our control
and are difficult to predict. There may be exigent circumstances, factors, or considerations that may cause the implementation of other measures or exceptions in specific instances.
Our ability to achieve any stated environmental, social or governance goal, target or objective is subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of which are outside our control. We can give no assurances that any plan, initiative, goal, target, objective, commitment or expectation will be achieved.
