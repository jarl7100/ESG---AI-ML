VICE PRESIDENT, INFRASTRUCTURE DATA CENTERS
2024 Sustainability Report
 In early 2024, we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the launch of Facebook, coming off a year focused on efficiency and artificial intelligence (AI) in 2023. We challenged ourselves to uncover new opportunities to streamline our processes and deliver the additional data center capacity to support the AI demand, while keeping our eye on our sustainability progress.
Since 2020, we have maintained net zero emissions in our global operations. To get there we reduced our emissions by 94% from a 2017 baseline, primarily by matching 100% of the electricity use of our data centers and offices with renewable energy and addressing the remaining emissions with projects that remove carbon from the atmosphere.
Meeting our goal to achieve net zero value chain emissions in 2030 will be significantly harder. The challenge of reaching our sustainability goals given the increased demand for energy and resources driven by AI is not unique to Meta. And it will require major shifts in how companies like ours operate.
Since breaking ground on our first data center back in 2010, we’ve built a global infrastructure that serves as the engine for the more than three billion people who use our technologies and programs every day. AI has been an important part of these systems for many years. (CONT.)

better reality
We see our role as protecting people and the planet through responsible operations — reducing our emissions and the energy and water used to power our data centers that enable access to our technologies — while protecting workers and the environment in
our supply chain.
We set expectations with respect to the environment, labor and human rights in our operations and supply chain. This means ensuring that suppliers that produce and procure hardware adhere to standards that support safe, healthy and fair working conditions.
At the same time, we acknowledge we will not realize this vision on our own. We continue to collaborate with multi-stakeholder groups, community members, climate action leaders and scientists to innovate beyond what is possible today and work to achieve net zero emissions across our value chain and become water positive in 2030.

Path to net zero
As climate change impacts become increasingly prevalent, decarbonizing our business is a critical step for Meta to do our part in supporting a healthier planet and more resilient communities. Since 2020, we have maintained net zero emissions in our global operations and matched 100% of our electricity use with renewable energy. We have also set a goal to achieve net zero emissions across our value chain in 2030.
Our value chain emissions continue to fluctuate as
our business expands and recently constructed data centers come online. This underscores the long-term efforts needed to decouple emissions growth from anticipated business growth. In order to reliably reverse the trajectory of our emissions in the coming years,
we must expand our decarbonization measures today — both at Meta and with our suppliers — so that the design of our infrastructure and global operations
are compatible with a zero-carbon future. We are prioritizing action toward near-term efforts, while also setting targets and making long-term decisions that indicate where we want the world to be in the future.

Understanding our emissions
Identifying the sources of our emissions from our direct operations to our supply chain enables us to prioritize emission reductions where we can make the most impactful progress on our path to net zero. As Meta decarbonizes its operations and value chain, the data and tools that help us to understand our emissions will evolve, enabling us to more efficiently deploy interventions to reduce our emissions.
In 2023, we leveraged our expertise in data science to increase the granularity and speed with which we track our emissions. We created a unified data model (UDM) for our emissions, which consolidates several GHG data sources from our global offices and data centers into a single point of access.
This consolidation helps us to streamline our data collection process, improving data governance and enabling us to quickly measure and manage our emissions.
We also improved our ability to measure and reduce the emissions from our data center hardware through an innovative approach for estimating server component emissions. Calculating emissions at the component-level is a challenge because many of the companies manufacturing source materials do not have the scale or resources to quantify and track GHG metrics. As a response, we developed a methodology to estimate and track the carbon emissions of hundreds of millions of components
in our data centers.
The methodology incorporates component-level, cost-based estimates and resource-intensive
Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). We complement calculations with internal materials modeling
and third party tools and databases such as the imec.netzero↗ tool and ACT↗ tool. This suite of methods and the associated data pipelines enable a more comprehensive and detailed overview of the embodied carbon in our entire IT hardware fleet.

Reducing our emissions
Reducing GHG emissions across our global operations and value chain remains the most effective strategy to reach net zero. Failure to reduce emissions today will lock in high-carbon intensity business tomorrow. We have set a science-based emissions reduction target in line with what is necessary to transition to a zero- carbon future, and have roadmapped our strategy to systematically transform the way we do business.
We’ve committed to:
• Reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 42% in 2031 from a 2021 baseline.
• Enabling at least two-thirds of our suppliers to set science-aligned GHG reduction targets by 2026.
• Not exceeding our 2021 baseline Scope 3 emissions by the end of 2031.

 Q and A with
David Hitchings
SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAM MANAGER, ENVIRONMENTAL METRICS ACCOUNTING
Tell us about your role with Meta.
I regularly engage with data owners across Meta to collect data for our environmental disclosures. My objective is to facilitate complete, accurate and transparent disclosures.
How has the company's approach to data changed over time?
When we began collecting environmental data in 2011, reporting was voluntary. Initially, it was challenging to collect data and ensure it was complete, accurate, transparent and traceable.
Now, instead of relying on only our own team, data collection is spread across stakeholders on over 30 teams! Empowering stakeholders to take ownership of the data has helped us successfully integrate our efforts with those of the teams responsible for collecting and reporting company environmental data.
Much of my approach to data collection and analysis now is a focus on automation and implementing and adjusting processes to improve efficiency. We recently launched an internal, integrated data model designed to make the process less labor intensive for our internal stakeholders and to enable data-driven solutions for our emissions reduction strategies.

 Reporting and assurance seems to be constantly changing. Is this evolution beneficial or is stability what everyone’s really craving?
As demand for non-financial reporting increases, assurance can drive continuous improvement and provide that extra stamp of confidence for the data that is being disclosed. Corporate sustainability is going through a huge growth phase and is constantly evolving so it is important for reporting and assurance to adapt to
these changes.
The evolution of reporting and assurance is beneficial for standardizing
data across companies, which will ideally stabilize and remove some of the uncertainties for companies who choose to continue voluntary disclosures in addition to complying with new regulations. Data standardization also drives increased confidence in decision making. It is important, however, to allow for continuous evolution as new technologies are developed and new solutions for organizations to operate more sustainably are identified and implemented.

Renewable energy highlights
For more than a decade, part of our strategy to reduce our operational emissions has been through adding new renewable energy to grids where we have data center operations. Meta is one of the largest corporate buyers of renewable energy, with over 11,700 MW of contracted renewable energy. We matched 100% of our electricity use with renewable energy by adding new wind and solar projects to local grids, including those where our data centers are located, which helps drive the transition to renewable energy. We have
the largest operating corporate renewable energy portfolio in the US for the second year running, with more than 6,700 MW online.
By the end of 2023, Meta globally supported 98 projects, 76 of which were operational.
In 2023, we conducted an economic impact study↗ that looked at the renewable energy contracts Meta had entered into in the US through the end of 2022. It found that by 2025, the 86 studied Meta-supported wind and solar projects located across 24 US states and 74 counties will add up to 9,800 MW of renewable energy to local grids and support more than $8 billion in GDP throughout the US economy.
2024 Sustainability Report
  As a result of the renewable energy that we have procured, we have reduced our operational emissions by 5.1 million tons of CO2e in 2023. We also apply additional renewable energy certificates to our Scope 3 emissions to reduce emissions associated with fuel- and energy-related activities, customer use of our consumer hardware, including Meta Quest headsets, and employees working from home. As a result, we have reduced our value chain emissions by 1.4 M tons of CO2e in 2023. Renewable energy procurement has helped us reduce our overall emissions by a total of 16.4 M tons of CO2e since 2021.

 Q and A with
Carolyn Campbell
HEAD OF RENEWABLE ENERGY, EAST
Describe your day-to-day role at Meta.
I oversee a team tasked with securing new renewable energy projects to continue matching 100% of our electricity use with renewable energy. This includes understanding data center capacity and electricity demand signals from the business, sourcing projects opportunities and negotiating agreements.
How has the company's approach to renewable energy changed over time?
From the early days of the program, we have always looked to add new renewable energy projects in close proximity to our operations. As we’ve continued to add renewable energy to the markets in which we operate, we’ve started to think more about the impact of each incremental MWh of clean energy we add to the grid. At the same time, we are working to maximize emissions reductions across the electricity system.
To achieve this, we focus on staying ahead of the curve and thinking creatively. We are working with partners across the industry to increase the level of detailed data available about the actual emissions coming from electricity consumed at our facilities and the emissions avoided by electricity produced by the renewable energy projects supporting our operations.

 2024 Sustainability Report
  A key component of this work is partnering with standards setting bodies to ensure companies can access the tools needed to support their electricity emissions strategies.
Meta has joined several leading companies on the Emissions First partnership↗, a set of new objectives and principles to update purchased electricity GHG emissions accounting systems (Scope 2) and help ensure we have clear ways to measure emissions reductions to unlock decarbonization investments at scale. This strategy will help Meta and others assess the emissions impact of purchased clean and renewable electricity, and optimize those purchases to maximize their emissions-reduction impacts.
How is Meta working to extend the availability of renewable energy in its supply chain?
We want to align with industry to reduce barriers to supplier decarbonization. We see how inefficient it is for individual companies to reach out to suppliers with bespoke asks, bespoke training systems. We can move much more quickly together.
A key example of our efforts is our contribution as a founding member of the Clean Energy Procurement Academy (CEPA)↗.
Engaging in meaningful partnerships is critical to the success of our efforts to accelerate decarbonization for our suppliers and broader industry.

HOW WE COLLABORATE:
Renewable energy partnerships
ZEROgrid
We’ve seen the impact corporate renewable energy commitments have had in adding clean energy to the grid. We are partnering with Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) and other leading companies on a new effort, the Zero Emissions | Reliability Optimized Grid Initiative or ZEROgrid↗, that will develop a roadmap and action plan to foster increased corporate climate investments that maximize the potential for moving to truly zero emissions, and a more reliable grid.
Renewable energy and battery storage
In partnership with the local electrical utility (Salt River Project) and with the renewable developer Ørsted, a new solar plus storage project announced in 2023 will help match our Mesa, Arizona data center’s electricity use with 100% renewable energy. Under the agreement, Meta will receive the majority portion of the energy generated by Ørsted’s Eleven Mile Solar Center, a 300 MW solar farm and 300 MW, four-hour battery energy storage system currently under construction in Pinal County, Arizona.
Green tariffs
We partner with many of the largest utilities in the US to add renewable energy onto their systems in
ways that benefit both Meta and other customers. Not all utilities offer electric rates (or tariffs, as utilities call them) that allow customers to support their facilities with renewable energy projects. When this is
the case, we work with utility partners to create green tariffs that provide our facilities, and other energy customers, with the opportunity to pursue renewable energy projects via their retail electricity service and support their own sustainability goals. In 2023, under Idaho’s Green Energy Your Way program, a special contract was approved to support our data center in Kuna, Idaho with renewable energy.

Net zero supplier engagement program
The majority of our carbon footprint
is Scope 3 emissions. For these emissions outside of our operational control, we have developed the Net Zero Supplier Engagement Program to set expectations with key suppliers for committing to emissions reduction targets and support them in meeting those targets. These expectations
are incorporated into the supplier life cycle, including requests for proposals, contracts and supplier business reviews.
"Engaging suppliers is key to reaching our net zero in 2030 goal. We have worked to identify key suppliers, assess their climate maturity level and integrate them into our decarbonization journey. In a dynamic technology landscape, we are constantly adapting and learning to build a scalable program. Close supplier partnerships and cross-industry collaborations are key to creating a lasting GHG reduction plan."

We take supplier-provided data and information gathered through detailed conversations, and work with suppliers to focus emissions reductions in five main areas:
1. Energy efficiency
2. Renewable energy
3. Circularity
4. Transportation
5. Supplier engagement
In 2023, we provided capacity- building training to our suppliers on calculating emissions, setting science-aligned GHG targets, building and operationalizing
a GHG roadmap, creating a renewable energy procurement strategy and understanding renewable energy markets.
At the same time, we work to help suppliers identify actions they can take to meet near-term reduction targets. Through initiatives like energy assessments, we have uncovered opportunities for suppliers to install more efficient equipment, replace damaged parts and implement variable operation
controls for chilled water pumps and air handling units.
In 2021, we began working with
a pilot group of 39 key suppliers
to calculate and report their GHG emissions and look for emissions reduction opportunities. In 2022, we scaled the program to a total of 114 suppliers. By the end of 2026, we intend to engage with at least two-thirds of our suppliers to set science-aligned GHG reduction targets and we were more than half way to our supplier engagement goal at the end of 2023.
By the end of 2023, 28% of
our suppliers, based on their contribution to our emissions, have set science-aligned emissions reduction targets.
When we look to 2024, we have identified two priority efforts:
1. Continuing progress against our near- term supplier engagement targets.
2. Piloting and scaling supplier decarbonization solutions.

HOW WE COLLABORATE:
Clean Energy Procurement Academy
In 2023, Meta and five other leading corporations launched CEPA↗ to support and encourage supplier renewable energy purchases, to further decarbonization of global supply chains. The founding organizations pooled their expertise and internal training resources to design a shared training curriculum and delivery processes that enable trainees to rapidly mature as clean energy customers.
Recognizing that clean energy purchases in the supply chain are one of the core strategies most companies can leverage to reduce Scope 3 emissions, the Academy will educate supplier partners on how they can achieve climate progress through renewable energy purchases. CEPA will also foster new renewable energy buying communities, particularly in key manufacturing regions with an initial
focus on Asia.

Over the next five years, SABA members have committed to purchase SAF certificates representing nearly 50 million gallons of high-integrity SAF, which is equivalent to approximately 500,000 tons of abated CO2e. Since 2021, Meta has purchased nearly 2.5 million gallons of SAF certificates.
SAF is a drop-in fuel made with renewable or waste feedstocks that has up to an 80% lower carbon footprint than traditional jet fuel. The SAF we procure is certified by accredited third parties that independently verify that biofuel feedstocks are managed responsibly. Currently, SAF makes up less than 0.5% of global jet fuel supply. Through SABA and in coordination with our airline partners, Meta will continue to adopt SAF to help decrease the environmental footprint of business travel.

Sustainable product design
We have embedded sustainability considerations into the product development process for all new consumer hardware such as our Meta Quest headsets. This includes ease of repairing and recycling, using sustainable materials, having extended lifespans and using low-carbon manufacturing and transportation methods.
 Decarbonizing data centers with biofuel
Reliable power is critical to bring our technologies to life and anticipating grid power disruption is part of our facilities contingency planning. Decarbonizing necessary emergency backup power generators is critical to reach our net zero target while keeping our data centers operational.
Diesel consumption from backup power generation accounts for a considerable portion of the operational emissions from our data centers. As part of our ongoing efforts to improve efficiency, we’ve recently streamlined our backup generator maintenance procedures to significantly reduce our diesel fuel consumption. Additionally, we have begun piloting the use of hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) as a viable low-carbon alternative fuel
that can help us address backup power generation emissions. Sustainably sourced HVO, made with renewable feedstock, is a drop-in substitute for the diesel we rely on today and has the potential to reduce life-cycle emissions from 40-85%, depending on the feedstock. We are transitioning our backup generator fleet at our Clonee, Ireland data center to use HVO in 2024 to determine if the solution is a viable option for our full
data center fleet.

Investing in value chain interventions for emissions reductions
We believe the urgency of the climate crisis requires us to work to address emission sources across our value chain, even where we are unable to attribute the reductions to a particular value chain partner and need alternative approaches to measuring and claiming the emissions reductions.
Value chain interventions for emissions reduction
across our value chain offer a significant opportunity to decarbonize our business at the pace and scale required to achieve our emissions reduction targets. They also have the potential to spur the development of early- stage decarbonization technologies, build markets and transform the sectors in which we and our value chain partners operate. The voluntary renewable energy market has shown the influence of market-based instruments and project-level investment to drive system-level decarbonization by enabling investors and purchasing companies to deploy clean technologies at scale. We see value in replicating these systems and markets for other decarbonization technologies that can scale investment across sectors and countries.
Our LCAs and supplier-reported emissions data show that the majority of our emissions are created multiple tiers upstream in our supply chain and often from commodities where there is currently no viable approach to trace emissions through our partners. While we may not be able to pinpoint the exact supplier and source of emissions, or when we know the source but the solutions to decarbonize are not available in a region, investing in value chain emission reduction projects can drive near- term reductions at scale.
In order to accelerate decarbonization, Meta launched
a request for information (RFI)↗ for value chain interventions for emissions reduction. The results of
the RFI have enabled our team to shorten the time and resources required to evaluate and pursue projects across the following sectors:
• Trucking and lighter duty road transportation of durable goods
• Maritime shipping
• Aviation shipping
• Increasing the production or offtake of low-carbon cement and concrete
• Increasing the production or offtake of low-carbon copper
• Increasing the production or offtake of low-carbon steel
• Abating fluorinated greenhouse gases in electronics manufacturing
• Heating and cooling of commercial and industrial facilities
• Increasing production and offtake of green hydrogen
We believe these early stage projects can serve as demonstrations of the remarkable potential for decarbonization at scale throughout corporate value chains. Meta will be conducting an RFP for these types of projects in 2024, and we will share updates on these projects in future reports and how they contribute to our emissions reduction goals.

Removing remaining emissions
2024 Sustainability Report
 While our climate strategy prioritizes emissions reduction, some residual emissions from hard-to-abate sectors will remain by 2030. Any residual emissions we cannot eliminate will require carbon removal projects to reach our net zero goal.
Our carbon removal strategy seeks to expand the voluntary carbon market toward projects that offer environmental and social benefits beyond carbon sequestration alone, as well as to drive innovation in new carbon removal technologies. We will help scale the market through forward contracts, such as our agreement with Catona Climate↗ to secure 6.75 million metric tons of nature-based carbon removal credits to be delivered from 2027 through 2035, as well as through advance market commitments with our peers, such as the Symbiosis Coalition↗ announced
in 2024. We also seek to support the market via other technological contributions that overcome barriers to scale, such as remote sensing↗ to ultimately aid in the monitoring and verification of forest carbon.
We believe we have an important role to play in advancing the development and accessibility of both natural and technological carbon removal↗ solutions. Each project type offers different pathways to impact at scale, on both immediate and longer-term timelines.
Emerging technologies like direct air capture (DAC) offer a high global climate mitigation potential and will be a necessary complement to emissions reductions and nature-based removals for the world to reach a zero-carbon future. Nature-based carbon removal via things like forests or soils is deployable now and can offer solutions to both mitigate climate change and address the biodiversity crisis. We prioritize ecological restoration↗ as well as projects that directly benefit people’s lives and livelihoods, such as by increasing food security or providing additional sources of income. These types of projects are especially important
for communities most affected by the impacts
of climate change.

Carbon removal partnerships
National Indian Carbon Coalition
Through 1t.org, the National Indian Carbon Coalition and Meta have pledged↗ to promote a model for carbon removal projects that centers on the leadership, traditional ecological knowledge and vision of Indigenous Peoples for themselves and the land they caretake. Through this partnership, we pledge to develop no fewer than three carbon removal credit generating projects that protect and restore forest lands through Indigenous/tribal and community leadership.
Emerging carbon removal technologies
In 2023, Meta signed contracts with CarbonCapture and Heirloom↗ to deliver carbon removal credits from DAC projects. When paired with geologic storage, DAC offers high carbon storage durability and a limited physical footprint making it a potentially readily scalable and promising carbon removal pathway. Meta also signed a contract with Charm Industrial↗, which sequesters carbon by storing pyrolyzed waste biomass into geologic formations deep underground. Novel carbon removal technologies like these require early adoption from companies like Meta to help scale up and bring costs down, and we will continue to support technologies like these to accelerate additional tools to help the world reach
a zero carbon future.

Data center circularity
2024 Sustainability Report
 We leverage the principles of circularity to limit the use of new materials in product development and construction, help us minimize and prevent waste and avoid upstream emissions.
To enable greater circularity within our supply
chain, we focus on eliminating the use of hazardous substances and prioritizing the responsible reuse and recycling of electronic equipment. Our Materials of Concern Standard and Electronics Reuse and Recycling Standard are updated regularly to support safe and healthy environments for anyone who manufactures, uses or recycles Meta hardware.
We also prioritize the use of post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastics and recycled metal in our hardware to enable a more circular supply chain, and thus, reduce the embedded carbon in our hardware.
Avoiding emissions in our upstream supply chain means using less, where possible. To achieve this, we are investing in systems that will extend the life of our hardware and reusing as many components as possible in our data center hardware.
Since 2021, we have been validating the reliability
and quality of reused components through a rigorous evaluation process and have landed hundreds of new server racks containing reused components within our fleet. The quality of the reused components continues to show excellent results; some of our oldest racks with reused components are already at two years of age and continue to perform well under real-world production workloads.

 Climate risks and resilience
Climate resilience enhances our ability to prepare for, recover from and adapt to the acute and chronic physical risks from climate change while we transition to net zero. As we continue on
our journey to enhance our resilience to climate change, we are embedding climate action into our business strategies, financial planning and governance structure. We are committed to sound corporate governance practices and encouraging effective, efficient and climate- informed policy- and decision-making.
  Leadership messages Executive summary How we operate What we create Data index 45

To understand the impacts we may experience in the near-, medium- and long-term under variety of future climate scenarios we conduct ongoing transition and physical risk and opportunity assessments across our operations, infrastructure and supply chain. This helps us take the right measures to enhance our adaptive capacity and resilience to these risks.
Our findings show our most noteworthy risks to be:
• Transition: The stigmatization of
the sector due to the perception of GHG impacts of global technology infrastructure, challenged by new global regulations that may lead to increased operational costs.
• Physical: Climate-related extreme weather events, especially in the US where the majority of our data centers are located, causing disruptions that may lead to incremental data center operation costs and interruptions to our programs.
We rely on scenario analysis to understand our exposure and vulnerability to climate risks in the future including physical chronic (e.g., sea level rise, higher annual average temperatures, changing precipitation patterns), physical acute (e.g., heat waves, floods, hurricanes
and typhoons, wildfires, cold waves) and risks associated with the global transition to a low carbon economy.

Water stewardship
Three pillars drive our water stewardship program:
Minimizing water use Transparency Water restoration
Reducing operational water use
The bulk of water consumption in data centers is attributed to the management of air flow and cooling of the server halls. This involves managing temperature and humidity levels to ensure optimal performance and longevity of the IT equipment. Cooling the servers is crucial due to the heat they generate. Humidity control prevents equipment damage, electrostatic issues and corrosion, and supports efficient cooling and a comfortable working environment.
Meta is continuously striving to design and operate data centers as water-efficiently as possible. As a Platinum member↗ of the US Green Building Council and its LEED Advisory and Technical committees, we help shape the future of its green rating system for data centers.
Transparency
We report on our water stewardship program and progress toward the Water Positive goal annually in our Sustainability Report. We also publish detailed information on each of our water restoration projects in our annual Volumetric Water Benefits Report↗. Detailed information on how we calculate these values and assess water risk can be found here.
Water restoration
Meta will restore more water than we consume in our operations through water restoration projects that address shared water challenges in the watersheds where we operate. At the watershed level, we will restore 200% of consumption in high water stress regions, and 100% of consumption in medium water stress regions — and overall we will be water positive in 2030.

 Since 2017, we have funded or supported more than 25 water restoration projects in eight watersheds where we operate. Once all projects are fully implemented, they will restore 1.9 billion gallons of water annually. In 2023, the operational restoration projects returned over 1.5 billion gallons of water to high and medium water stress regions.
Each water restoration project is unique and designed to address local conditions, but there are generally four categories of water restoration projects in our portfolio: Conservation and ecosystem restoration;
Water supply and reliability; Water Access, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH); and Water quality.
For most water restoration projects, we work with NGO partners to identify and develop projects to address local water challenges. These are long term partnerships, lasting up to 10 years.
Our renewable energy procurement avoids water consumption associated with typical nonrenewable energy sources. As a result, we estimate we have saved over 31 billion gallons of water since 2021.

Longleaf pine forest restoration
Trinity River Watershed, Texas
Meta partnered with Texan by Nature, the Texas Longleaf Team and several companies to invest nearly $1M to restore 2,000 acres of longleaf pine forest in Trinity County, Texas. The restoration includes managing and removing invasive plants, conducting prescribed fires and planting 100,000 seedlings over the course of five to ten years.
A healthy longleaf pine ecosystem will filter and store freshwater, sequester carbon, support biodiversity and benefit the community. Through restoration of the 2,000 acres, increased water filtration is projected to provide over 200 million gallons per year.
Alta Harris Creek side channel
Boise River Watershed, Idaho
The Barber Dam, in the Boise River, acts as a barrier to migrating fish. Meta is supporting Trout Unlimited in constructing a passage allowing fish to bypass the dam by reconnecting the Alta Harris Creek Side Channel with the Boise River.
This will reestablish a robust riparian corridor, improve aquatic spawning and rearing habitat for salmonid fishes and provide continuous fish passage to the Boise River.
This project ensures that the Alta Harris Creek Side Channel will have a consistent flow of water from the Boise river, preventing “no-flow” periods in the creek, thereby supporting this ecosystem in being more resilient to climate change-related droughts and decreasing snowpack availability. This project will increase streamflow by 149 million gallons of water per year.

SRP forest and water restoration
Colorado River Watershed, Arizona
The Verde River is one of Arizona’s most important waterways, providing water to people in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area and its surroundings as part of the Salt River Project (SRP). The first stretch of the Verde River’s flow is supplied by water that emerges from springs, but these springs are currently under threat from increasing water consumption.
The 1990 Dude Fire, a high-severity wildfire that occurred near Payson, Arizona, led to the widespread destruction of forests in the Verde River watershed. Restoring parts of the Verde River watershed that are at high risk of or have been degraded from wildfire presents an opportunity to repair the damage that has already been caused and to improve hydrologic function to enhance SRP’s ability to provide resilient water supplies for the Phoenix Metro area. Meta is partnering with SRP, state, federal, local and private partners on a forest restoration project that will improve the wildfire resilience of the area, decrease the vegetative water demand, avoid water quality degradation and increase surface water flows by more than 5 million gallons per year.
Colorado River Indian Tribes (CRIT) drip irrigation
Colorado River Watershed, Arizona
Scarce water and increasing federal cutbacks are fueling the need to reduce water waste in the Colorado River basin. In Arizona, where agriculture is critical to the economy of the Colorado River Indian Tribes (CRIT), Meta is partnering with the CRIT and N-Drip to replace flood irrigation with drip irrigation, reducing water usage, evaporation and runoff by providing water directly to the soil slowly.
The application of N-Drip technology will result in a savings of 96.4 million gallons of water per year. Such savings will help support resilient economic development on the reservation through agriculture while also helping to create more flexibility in how the CRIT uses its water, opening the door for tribal water management that can support system conservation agreements to leave water in Lake Mead.

Protecting workers in the manufacturing process
Protecting workers from environmental, health and safety risks is a key part of our RSC mission and the RBA Code of Conduct. Our Materials of Concern Standard and Electronics Reuse and Recycling Standard support safe and healthy environments for anyone who manufactures, uses or recycles Meta hardware. We are building our in-house expertise and partnering with leading industry experts who support conducting specialized assessments on specific topics like machine safeguarding or environmental impact assessments.
We have advanced our programmatic focus on reducing exposure to hazardous chemicals by supporting safe process chemical management
at supplier sites, utilizing the RBA Industry Focus Process Chemicals (IFPC) Policy↗ as a foundation and engaging in the industry’s efforts to move towards substitution and elimination. Our Supplier IFPC Engagement Strategy aims to support supplier conformance to IFPC requirements, build the capacity of suppliers to safely manage process chemicals and encourage their use of safer alternatives.
In 2023, we expanded the reach of our process chemicals program to additional hardware suppliers. We used surveying tools, desktop reviews and in- person chemical management assessments to
evaluate the use of process chemicals by key supplier sites and assess their policies and procedures to protect worker safety. We used the results of these assessments to inform suppliers’ capacity-building needs, corrective actions and improvement plans, and continue monitoring for process chemical use
on an annual basis.
Reducing forced labor risks
Excessive working hours is a persistent challenge throughout the electronics manufacturing industry and represents an ILO risk factor that could lead to forced labor incidents. Meta requires that suppliers conform with the RBA Code of Conduct, which is aligned to global standards on working hours and local laws at manufacturing locations. Our team works on managing risks and remediating audit findings related to excessive overtime through several activities including on-site visits, corrective action plan (CAP) management, key performance indicator data, supplier training and worker surveys, if needed. For example, worker surveys provide employees an anonymous channel to share their experiences with overtime and if it is voluntary. Through this holistic approach, we are reducing the risks of forced labor incidents within our supply chain.

We use worker surveys, capacity building programs and other worker engagement activities at strategic supplier sites to understand workers’ needs and perspectives. Survey results inform supplier management teams on how
to shape action plans to address root cause issues and further support workers. We also analyze results to understand performance trends over time in comparison to benchmark data where available.
In 2023, we expanded the reach of the worker wellbeing program to new data centers and Reality Labs supplier sites.
Through a cross-functional partnership in 2023,
for example, we deployed a worker resilience program to further support safe and resilient workplaces for hardware supply chain workers. Through a supplier-led model, the program provided hands-on educational training at a key supplier site that focused on fire safety, first aid and worker satisfaction.
2024 Sustainability Report
 The worker resilience program brings internal sourcing and operations teams together to work with suppliers. By supporting ways to improve working conditions and job satisfaction, for example, we can further enable productive and safe operations as well as positive supplier relationships.

The loss of biodiversity has critical implications for humanity, from the collapse of food chains and health systems to the disruption of entire supply chains. According to the World Economic Forum’s 2024 Global Risks Report↗, biodiversity loss is listed as the third most severe risk on a global scale over the next
10 years.
We know that our operations and facilities have an impact on local habitats and we aim to preserve and restore more land than we impact. To
do so, we are taking steps to avoid harmful practices, reduce negative impacts on nature, lead on nature restoration at scale and accelerate the nature positive movement.
Between 2022 and 2023, we conducted a hotspot assessment of our full value chain and a detailed natural capital assessment of a selection of our operational sites. We are building upon these assessments and using the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) as a framework to inform our biodiversity strategy.

During site diligence for our data centers, sensitive biodiversity areas are identified, and during design and construction, impacts to them are avoided, minimized or mitigated. Historically, they are left alone and/or no further harm is done once the
site is operational.
>50%
More than half of the total area of
our US data center campuses is dedicated to native and biodiverse habitat. This includes preserved areas and areas with planned or already initiated restoration of native species.
2024 Sustainability Report
  Each Meta data center site is designed to promote biodiversity through the planting of native and adaptive landscape, mimicking the site’s natural hydrology and reducing urban heat island effect. In 2023, we implemented a program to standardize our development approach that prioritizes the restoration of biodiverse native habitat over all of the non-built space across
our new offices and data center campuses — eliminating the use of nonnative ornamental species and largely avoiding turf everywhere.

AI for climate
Our climate-related AI initiatives, including Open Catalyst↗ and the Llama Impact Grants↗ program, are advancing climate action for the broader community.
Open sourcing our model for sustainable concrete
2024 Sustainability Report
   Concrete currently accounts for over 8% of carbon emissions worldwide.1 This can be reduced by making adjustments to concrete formulas that optimize for sustainability performance and technical performance criteria such as compressive strength gain and workability. The formulation and testing of concrete mixes to optimize for multiple variables can be costly and time-consuming without the use of AI.
To address this challenge, Meta developed an open source model↗ that uses an innovative approach to concrete formulation, integrating multiple performance requirements in collaboration with researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign↗.
The model outputs were refined in partnership with a local industry partner (Ozinga) to
generate concrete mixtures with up to a
40% lower carbon footprint than the regional industry standard. This lower-carbon concrete was used in multiple applications at our DeKalb, IL, data center campus. Variations of these mixtures have subsequently been used in at least two other sites, and enabled Meta to scale requirements to use low carbon concrete across its entire portfolio for future designs in specific applications.
We are partnering with top leaders in sustainable construction to collaborate on the expansion of this project, and utilize and fine tune this model for their needs. It is our hope that large-scale construction initiatives across the world will reduce the cost and carbon footprint of their projects by
utilizing this model.

Using AI to map the Earth’s forests
Forests harbor most of Earth’s terrestrial biodiversity and play a critical role in the uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Ecosystem services provided by forests underpin an essential defense against the climate and biodiversity crises. However, critical gaps remain in the scientific understanding of the structure and extent of global forests, particularly in dynamic and more dispersed forest systems such as agroforestry, drylands forests and alpine forests, which together constitute more than a third of the world’s forests. Higher resolution forest data has the potential to dramatically improve the monitoring of conservation and restoration efforts globally. This is important for both forest-based carbon credit projects and other conservation efforts focused on the preservation of forests.
We leveraged our DINOv2 AI training algorithm↗ and collaborated with World Resources Institute (WRI)↗ to launch an open source map of global tree canopy height↗ at a 1-meter resolution, allowing the detection of individual trees. We hope this high resolution canopy height data can ultimately be applied to forest biomass and carbon stock monitoring. Remote sensing can make the monitoring and verification of carbon removal projects more efficient and more accessible, especially for smaller scale projects in communities or initiatives that have a higher barrier to participate in the carbon market.

OpenDAC
A carbon removal solution with the potential for large-scale impact, DAC pulls CO2 out of ambient air through a recurring cycle facilitated by a sorbent or solvent. The resulting stream of liquified CO2 can then be sequestered through geologic storage.
Despite its potential, the broad implementation of DAC has been impeded by high costs. The discovery of novel sorbents is one method to increase efficiency and reduce cost.
The OpenDAC↗ project is a collaborative research project between Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) at Meta and Georgia Tech, aimed at significantly reducing DAC costs. Along with the dataset, we released state-of-the-art versions of our machine learning (ML) models trained on the dataset.
Since releasing the dataset, more than 200 promising sorbents for DAC have been identified, most of which were previously unknown candidates for this application.
2024 Sustainability Report
  Open sourcing foundational AI technologies reduces the barriers to entry so AI can be deployed not only by the technology companies that have the computing infrastructure to train large models, but by the broader community of developers and organizations that stand to benefit from these innovations.

Data center operational efficiency
Efficiency efforts in our data centers are not new to Meta and will continue as we work to meet the increasing energy and server demands of AI.
Some examples of our data center efficiency efforts include:
1. Custom power profiles: Since data center provisioned power is a limited resource, we only enable higher power configurations for servers running workloads which significantly benefit from extra power. This allows us
to efficiently use both energy and server capacity, reducing our overall footprint.
More information can be found in our research paper, “Expanding Datacenter Capacity
with DVFS Boosting: A safe and scalable deployment experience”↗.
2. Reuse existing capacity: We work to identify and safely repurpose idle capacity for workloads that tolerate lower availability requirements. More details on this effort could be found in this presentation, “Dynamic Leasing of Spare Capacity to Improve Fleet Utilization with Optimus”↗.
3. Improve workload efficiency: Efficiency efforts rely on observability tools like our open-sourced Dynolog↗ to understand the root-causes of inefficiencies in the systems.

Leveraging insights from our global community can help organizations better deliver programs and improve climate focused research to make scientific advances more quickly.
Data for Good
Data for Good at Meta empowers partners with privacy- preserving data to strengthen communities and advance social issues. The majority of Data for Good tools are shared in an open source format, an approach that reduces barriers to entry, removes bureaucratic roadblocks to collaboration and increases the team’s global impact.
In collaboration with the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and Rare’s Center for Behavior & the Environment, Meta fielded the 2023 Climate Opinion Survey from August 3–September 3, 2023 in 187 countries and territories worldwide. This survey and associated
report found that although hundreds of millions of people worldwide still know little to nothing about climate change, once informed, majorities in nearly every area say they are “somewhat” or “very” worried about the subject2. Analyzing information from people who use Facebook in countries defined as low-emissions and low per-capita income, Yale and Rare also found that majorities of respondents reported experiencing at least one extreme weather event and that respondents in nearly all areas were more likely to say they had experienced long periods of unusually hot weather3.

Support for climate policy
Climate action is critical to achieving a sustainable economy and protecting our planet. We are working internally to decarbonize our overall business operations and supply chain and reduce our overall environmental footprint.
Meta also acknowledges that comprehensive and well-designed climate and clean energy policy
is central to transitioning to a future that avoids the worst impacts of climate change. We work with policy makers, partner organizations, trade groups and
industry peers to advance climate and clean energy policies. This includes membership in the Clean Energy Buyers Alliance (CEBA), Advanced Energy United (AEU), American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES) and Clean Grid Alliance (CGA). Our memberships should not be viewed as an endorsement of every policy position that individual organizations or their leadership take.
We believe that for Meta to reach our own net zero emissions goal, we need governments around the world to move toward a net zero economy. Outside of the US, we are members of the European Climate Pact, Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact, Digital Europe, Re-Source and Asia Clean Energy Coalition (ACEC) to support well-designed climate and clean energy policy around the world.

Forward-looking statements
This report covers only the Meta business and does not address the performance or operations of our suppliers, contractors or partners. Statements regarding targets, goals and commitments are aspirational and may also be based on estimates and assumptions under developing standards that may change in the future. As such, no guarantees or promises are made that they will be met
or successfully executed, and actual results may differ, possibly materially. In addition, data, statistics and metrics included in this report are non-audited estimates, not necessarily prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, continue to evolve and may be based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time of preparation but may be subject to revision. This report has not been externally assured or verified by an independent third party unless otherwise noted. This report represents our current policy and intent and is not intended to create legal rights or obligations.
In this report, our use of the terms “material,” “materiality” and other similar terms is consistent with that of GRI, SASB, TCFD and other standards referenced in the preparation of this report, or refers to topics that reflect our significant economic, social and environmental impacts or that substantially influence the assessments and decisions of a diverse set of stakeholders. We are not using these terms
as they are used under the securities or other laws of the United States or any other jurisdiction or as these terms are used in the context of financial statements and financial reporting. This report is not comprehensive, and for that reason, should be read in conjunction with our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, our subsequent reports
on Forms 10-Q and 8-K and other filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
This report contains forward-looking statements. All statements contained in this report other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our
future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans and our objectives for future operations, as well statements regarding targets, goals and commitments, are forward-looking statements. The words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect” and similar expressions are intended
to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results
of operations, business strategy, short-term and longterm business operations and objectives, and financial needs.
Especially with respect to the matters discussed in this report, many factors and uncertainties relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control, influence whether any forward-looking statements can or will be achieved. Any one of those factors, including as the result of changes in circumstances, estimates
that turn out to be incorrect, standards of measurement that change over time, assumptions not being realized
or other risks or uncertainties, could cause our actual results, including the achievement of targets, goals or commitments, to differ materially from those expressed or implied in writing in any forward-looking statements made by Meta or on its behalf.

2023 environmental metrics methodology
At Meta, our sustainability work helps us to operate efficiently and responsibly in our mission to build community and bring the world closer together. As a global company, we recognize the tech industry’s environmental impact and role to play in addressing climate change. We embrace the responsibility to understand the full scope of our footprint and be transparent and accountable in our mission to reduce our emissions.
Identifying the source of our emissions on an annual basis enables us to prioritize emissions reduction where we can make the most meaningful progress on our path to net zero emissions across our value chain in 2030. Similarly, minimizing our water use, being transparent with our water data and restoring water in the same watersheds where our data centers are located are vital to reach our commitment to restore more water than we use by 2030.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Our GHG footprint includes the emissions associated with running our business and data centers, as well as the indirect emissions upstream and downstream of our global operations. These emissions correspond to Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions as defined by World Resources Institute’s (WRI) GHG Protocol↗. Meta uses the operational control approach when calculating our GHG footprint, in which we account for 100% of the GHG emissions over which we have operational control.
Operational emissions
Scope 1 and 2 emissions are considered our operational emissions. Scope 1 emissions come from our direct operations, such as combustion of natural gas to heat our offices and the fuel burned in our employee shuttles. Scope 2 includes indirect emissions from purchased energy, such as the electricity powering our data centers. We consider purchased electricity for construction outside of our operational control and therefore report these in Scope 3.
• Stationary combustion (e.g., natural gas consumed at our Menlo Park campus for heating)
• Mobile combustion (e.g., diesel emissions from our intercampus shuttles)
• Fugitive emissions (e.g., refrigerant losses)
• Purchased electricity
• District heating
• Stationary combustion from leased sites
In 2020, Meta reduced our operational emissions by 94% from a 2017 baseline and addressed the residual emissions with high-quality carbon removal projects. As a result, our operations have produced net zero emissions since then.
Full value chain emissions1
Scope 3 emissions come from sources within our full value chain beyond our operations and comprise the largest component of our footprint. Scope 3 includes:
1. Upstreamemissions,suchastheemissionsfrommanufacturingourdatacenterserversoremissionsfromemployeecommuting;and 2. Downstream emissions, such as the emissions associated with consumers using our Meta Quest VR headset devices.
1. Category 10: Processing of sold products, Category 13: Downstream leased assets, Category 14: Franchises and Category 15: Investments are determined to not be relevant.

How we calculate our GHG emissions
Meta is aligning our emissions reduction targets with the Science Based Targets initiative↗ and takes a scientific, standardized approach to calculating its GHG emissions in accordance with the GHG Protocol↗. Furthermore, our GHG emissions data undergoes limited assurance conducted by a third party. This is completed annually to provide additional confidence to our publicly reported metrics.
We quantify our GHG emissions via activity data, Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) and financial data. We prioritize calculating our emissions through activity data, which directly measures an activity that results in GHG emissions such as kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity. Due to the complex nature of our business and value chain, we use other methods to help calculate our emissions when activity data is not available.
We measure our emissions by metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, or CO2e, units. CO2e is used to standardize the emissions from different greenhouse gases based on their global warming potentials.
Activity data
For activity data, we take the quantity of a specific measured activity and multiply it by an associated emissions factor to calculate the total emissions from that activity. For example, the kWh of electricity consumed at a Meta site is multiplied by the appropriate country-specific or regional-specific, publicly available emissions factor to calculate the total emissions from that site’s electricity use. We use activity data to calculate:
• Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions
• Fuel and energy-related activities
• Waste generated in operations
• Upstream Transportation and Distribution where supplier specific data is available
• Business travel (including radiative forcing)
• Employee commuting
• Direct use of our augmented and virtual reality related consumer hardware
Scope 3 emissions
Our value chain emissions upstream and downstream of our operations
        Leadership messages Executive summary How we operate What we create Data index P
 
Where activity data is incomplete or unavailable for an operation that results in GHG emissions, existing activity data is used as a proxy to estimate these emissions. This ensures we are reporting a complete GHG inventory across all of our operations. For example, the weight of waste at several Meta sites is used as a proxy to estimate waste at other sites in the same region that do not have final waste weight data.
Life cycle assessments (LCAs)
To understand cradle-to-gate emissions and/or upstream emissions that are released before certain assets are used (e.g., the emissions released from the production of concrete before it is poured), we conduct third-party LCA studies or utilize LCA tools to measure our impact. This is applicable in our most recent GHG inventory for the following emissions:
• Upstream emissions associated with the materials used in the construction of our data centers
• Upstream emissions of materials in office renovations and new construction
• Cradle-to-gate emissions of our augmented and virtual reality related consumer hardware, such as our Meta Quest VR headset devices
• Cradle-to-gate emissions in key data center hardware components, such as hard drives
• End-of-life treatment of our augmented and virtual reality related consumer hardware
Financial
Our Environmentally Extended Input Output (EEIO) method utilizes financial spend data and applies industry-specific emission factors (e.g., kg CO2e per dollar spent on electronic manufacturing) published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)↗ to calculate “cradle- to-gate” emissions. We apply the EEIO method to the following:
• Purchased goods and services
• Capital goods not related to data center and office construction, augmented and virtual reality related consumer hardware and key data center hardware components
• Upstream transportation and distribution where supplier specific data is unavailable
• Upstream leased assets
Market-based instruments
We have publicly committed to matching 100% of our electricity use with renewable energy including wind, solar and hydropower. We procure and retire one Energy Attribute Certificate (EAC) for every megawatt hour of electricity used to power our global operations. Meta also procures and retires one EAC for every megawatt hour of electricity use in select Scope 3 categories.2 Additionally, Meta procures Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and applies the associated emissions reductions from SAF allocated in the reporting year as a market-based instrument to Category 6: Business Travel.
A core focus of Meta’s renewable energy program is adding new renewable energy projects to the electricity grids that support our data centers to drive the transition to renewable energy in our communities. In alignment with these principles, Meta adheres to the following EAC market boundaries:
1. Owneddatacenters3:EACsfromthesamegridregion4
2. Leased data centers5: EACs from the same grid region or same geographic region6
3. Other Scope 2 loads (offices, points-of-presence): EACs from same grid region or same geographic region 4. Scope 3 loads: EACs from same grid region; once exhausted, EACs from same geographic region

Improving our GHG methodology
As Meta decarbonizes our value chain over the next decade, the data and methodology that drives our climate work will evolve and improve each year. We have disclosed our Scope 1 and 2 emissions for the last decade. We began reporting on some Scope 3 categories in 2015 and have reported on every relevant category defined by the GHG Protocol since 2019. As techniques to calculate our emissions improve, we will apply those methods to previous years to refine our GHG footprint. For example, in 2020 we used the EPA’s updated EEIO emission factors for our Scope 3 calculations and updated our 2019 data accordingly.
Going forward, we will focus on increasing accuracy and granularity of our data. For example, we recalculated our 2020 data based on updated LCA data for key data center hardware and our augmented and virtual reality related consumer hardware. We will use activity data for more emissions categories as methods to do so become available. We will continue reporting and updating our emissions boundaries as our business grows on our path to net zero emissions.
PUE/WUE
Each year, we calculate the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) and Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) of our data centers. PUE measures how efficiently our data centers consume the energy to operate our servers and network infrastructure. It is calculated by dividing the energy consumed at the data center by IT electricity load. The closer our annual PUE is to “1” indicates how efficient our data centers are designed to consume electricity.
Annual WUE is calculated by dividing our water withdrawal, in liters, by IT electricity load, in kWh. The closer WUE is to “0,” the more efficient consumption of water to cool our IT-related infrastructure.
These metrics are calculated based on best available data, including internal meters, design estimates and utility bills where applicable.
Water withdrawal
The water that we use in our offices and at our data centers are withdrawn from our local water utilities or local aquifers. We report our water withdrawals based on data from our local water utilities or meter data, where available. We also report our water withdrawal during construction, based on reported data from our construction partners. Not included in our 2022 operational water withdrawal numbers are an additional 1,780,000 cubic meters of water withdrawn for the construction of Meta data centers.
Water consumption
For our data centers, we determine our water consumption via two methods:
1. Calculatingthedifferencebetweenwaterwithdrawalandwastewaterdischarge
2. Calculating consumption based on cycles of concentration from our cooling systems
For our offices, we estimate our water consumption based on industry averages. All of our wastewater is discharged to local wastewater facilities.
Water risk
We use water stress metrics in the World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct tool↗ to conduct initial assessments of our water risks. When appropriate, we increase the level of water risk based on additional local knowledge.
