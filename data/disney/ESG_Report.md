DISCLOSURE PRIORITIES
As a diverse multinational organization, we
consider and address a large variety of topics
that relate to operating our businesses. To help
inform and evolve our efforts and our disclosures
on select topics, we evaluate stakeholder input
as well as existing and developing third-party
reporting frameworks. Our Data & Frameworks
section at the end of this report includes
disclosures derived from the Sustainability
Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards
(now part of the International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) Foundation); the Task Force on
Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), by
mapping to our Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)
disclosures; and the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). Additionally, we
include icons in various sections throughout this
report to indicate where information supports
specific SDGs and SASB indicators.
We have adjusted our reporting strategy this
year in light of upcoming regulatory
requirements. The topics that are discussed in
this report help to provide decision-useful
information to our stakeholders. For further
information on these topics in the form of topic
briefs, visit the ESG Reporting Center. For stories

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
We strive to adopt appropriate governance
policies and practices and have a Board of
Directors with relevant experience. The
companyʼs Board of Directors has 10 Directors,
whose backgrounds encompass a range of
talents, skills, and expertise, including experience
leading global organizations. Nine of those 10
Directors are independent.† Our Directors reflect
the companyʼs shareholders, employees,
customers, guests, and communities, with five
out of 10 Directors representing diverse gender,
ethnic, and/or racial backgrounds. As of the end of
fiscal 2024, all members of the Audit Committee,
Compensation Committee, and Governance and
Nominating Committee were independent.

ETHICS
SV-HL-310a.4
Disney conducts business in accordance with high
standards of business ethics and adopts policies
and practices designed to comply with applicable
laws, rules, and regulations. We hold our Board
of Directors accountable to our Code of Business
Conduct and Ethics for Directors. Our Standards
of Business Conduct (SOBC) apply to our
employees and include resources and tools that
help promote ethical conduct and compliance
with the law. We regularly engage our leaders
and employees on these standards through
training and other communications. Employees
can confidentially report ethical concerns to our
internal alert hotline, The Guideline.
All U.S.-based employees are covered by our
Equal Employment Opportunity Policy,
Prohibition of Harassment Policy, and our Speak
Up Policy, which encourages employees who
observe or suspect misconduct to speak up, to
provide the company with the opportunity to
address the concerns regarding adherence to
these policies. Employees outside the U.S. are
covered by policies reflecting these principles,
but tailored to their specific region.
Anti-Corruption
As a global company, we have a duty to comply
with applicable anti-corruption laws.
Whistleblower complaints with allegations of
bribery and corruption, fraud, and/or money
laundering are reviewed and investigated by
Global Ethics and Compliance Management. The
Company's Global Anti-Bribery and Anti-
Corruption Policy was updated in fiscal 2024.
Training on the SOBC and Global Anti-Bribery
and Anti-Corruption Policy are completed on a
recurring basis by employees.

RISK OVERSIGHT
Our Board of Directors, acting directly or
through its committees, is responsible for
assessing major risk factors relating to the
company and its performance and for reviewing
measures to address and mitigate such risks.
To help minimize the financial impact of
potential risks and support business continuity,
we use risk financing strategies including self-
insurance, contractual risk transfer, commercial
insurance, and alternative risk financing
techniques. Our Enterprise Risk Management
function provides insights by working across the
company with our business segments and units
to help identify, assess, and mitigate operational
risks—including those related to environmental
matters—with these risk financing strategies.

TAX STRATEGY
Our global tax strategy supports our
commitment to high standards of corporate
governance, transparency, and accountability in
the execution of our global business. Our tax
strategy and its underlying principles apply to
the controlled subsidiaries of The Walt Disney
Company and guide the decisions we make
relating to corporate tax matters. We incur taxes
in the countries where our activities take place,
and our policies prohibit tax evasion or the
facilitation of tax evasion. We work proactively
and transparently with tax authorities to resolve
tax positions that have the potential to result in
tax disputes.

HUMAN RIGHTS
SV-HL-310a.4
We are committed to respecting human rights,
including those of our employees, our guests and
customers, our communities, and our business
partners. Our Human Rights webpage identifies
our salient human rights issues in the following
areas: our people, our content, our products and
supply chains, our communities, children, and
privacy. We re-evaluate our salient issues as new
information becomes available.
Our commitment is informed by the United
Nations Guiding Principles on Business and
Human Rights, and recognizes the human rights
referenced in the United Nations International
Bill of Human Rights and the principles
referenced in the International Labour
Organizationʼs Declaration on Fundamental
Principles and Rights at Work and the
Convention on the Rights of the Child. This
commitment, along with our focus areas and
governance, are reflected in our various practices
and programs and are outlined in our Human
Rights Policy.
SUPPLY CHAIN
SV-HL-310a.4, CG-AA-430b.3
We are committed to working within our global
supply chains to foster safe, inclusive, and
respectful work environments. We collaborate
with suppliers around the world as part of our
efforts to prevent, mitigate, and remedy adverse
human rights impacts, as well as to reduce the
environmental impacts of our operations,
products, and services where we operate. We
also believe that with a wide range of suppliers
in our sourcing process, we can encourage
innovative, cost-effective, and high-quality
business solutions across the enterprise.
We purchase an extensive array of products,
materials, and services from thousands of
suppliers to support our operations. We expect
our suppliers to uphold the standards of our
Supply Chain Code of Conduct (the Code).
The Code is integrated into our business
operations, as appropriate, including through
a range of specific measures, to monitor and
assess compliance.
International Labor Standards
The Disney International Labor Standards (ILS)
program governs labor standards compliance
across the extensive supply chain for Disney-
branded consumer products. In accordance with
the ILS program, licensees and vendors
producing Disney-branded products in certain
countries must conduct audits and provide audit
reports on a regular basis. Requirements for our
ILS program are described in our ILS Program
Manual, as well as in supplemental guides,
including those about forced labor and health &
safety. The program is informed by our Human
Rights Policy, Supply Chain Code of Conduct,
and Standards of Business Conduct, along with a
range of other responsible business expectations.
To advance labor standards, we have
collaborated with outside organizations to help
incubate and pilot scalable tools and programs
through Disneyʼs Supply Chain Investment
Program (SCIP), which was launched in 2012.

PRODUCT SAFETY
The safety of products bearing Disney brands,
characters, and other intellectual property is very
important to us. Disney-branded consumer
products, spanning numerous categories, from
toys and apparel to books and fine art, are
produced by thousands of third-party licensees
and vendors around the world. Our product
safety program is designed to account for this
breadth, as well as the rapid changes in scientific
knowledge, evolving regulations, and customer
and community feedback. Our Supply Chain
Code of Conduct specifies our expectation that
suppliers deliver products and services that
comply with our safety and quality standards.
Our Product Integrity function oversees Disneyʼs
safety policies, procedures, and operating
requirements for physical products containing
Disney intellectual property across the enterprise
and is led by our Global Product & Labor
Standards function. Disney requires that
licensees and vendors contractually commit to
follow procedures to verify that Disney-branded
products comply with applicable safety
regulatory requirements and any additional
requirements that may be specified by Disney.
In conjunction with renowned independent
testing laboratories, Disney developed product
guidelines that specify applicable product safety
standards for numerous product categories and
geographic regions. These guidelines cover a
broad range of physical, mechanical,
toxicological, microbiological, flammability,
electrical, and chemical safety requirements.
They are available online for use by product
designers, licensees, and vendors. We require
compliance with product guidelines that include
testing performed by accredited third-party
laboratories for Disney-branded products
developed and sourced by Disney entities.
We have policies to manage the use of chemicals
in products and have a Priority Chemicals List
(PCL) that identifies substances we are working
to reduce in our branded products. For Disney-
branded products developed and sourced by
Disney entities, we have established thresholds
and timelines to reduce our use of these
chemicals. For our licensed products, we
encourage our licensees to similarly work to
reduce these chemicals. To address compliance
with our PCL policies, Disney uses a risk-based
approach that includes random audit testing on
select products and the submission of relevant
documentation by vendors. We conduct a
regular review of our PCL and consider various
approaches to chemicals management to
determine if changes are necessary.

Product Safety
WORKPLACE SAFETY
The safety of our employees is a top factor
in the decisions we make. Teams staffed by
professionals such as medical doctors and
nurses, professional engineers, certified
industrial hygienists, ergonomists, public
health and certified food professionals,
registered sanitarians, microbiologists, and
more help promote a safe work environment
for our employees.
Our internal programs and policies are designed
to promote a culture of safety, and our Standards
of Business Conduct and Injury and Illness
Prevention Plan provide the avenues to report
safety concerns and incidents. Employees can
report a safety concern in a number of ways,
including to a direct supervisor, our Global
Security Communications Center, an anonymous
safety line, or by making a report online through
our internal system, called The Guideline. In
addition, Safety and Wellness Committees in
certain areas of our businesses can assist
employees in sharing or reporting concerns. We
have global safety appreciation programs to
recognize employees for exhibiting outstanding
safety behaviors.

GUEST SAFETY
Safety is a top priority of Disneyʼs standards for
theme park excellence. Our Safety Team is
composed of experts from a broad range of
disciplines, including medicine, engineering,
quality assurance, maintenance, attraction
operations, facilities, ergonomics, industrial
hygiene, occupational safety, security, and food
safety. We conduct inspections at our properties
to monitor compliance with both internal
standards and regulations. We regularly provide
safety training and information to our cast and
crew members through formal instruction, on-
the-job training, ongoing communications, and
safety culture conversations. These safety culture
conversations are conducted throughout the year
with salaried leaders at our theme parks to share
safety stories, practices, and learnings designed
to engage our teams.
Ride Safety
According to the annual International
Association of Amusement Parks and Recreation
Ride Safety Report administered by the National
Safety Council, the industry injury rate per
million in attendance in ridership has decreased
by approximately 2.7% over the past two years,
from 0.73 in 2022 to 0.71 in 2023.† Over that
same timeframe, our U.S. Disney Parks reported
rates averaging 58% below the industry average.
Food Safety
Our parks and resorts take a multifaceted
approach to advancing food safety, including:
• A vendor food safety program requiring
suppliers to follow established food safety
protocols and demonstrate compliance with
regulatory requirements
• Food safety audits designed to verify adherence
to regulations and company standards; each
year, we conduct thorough measurements and
audits across our properties
• Education and rigorous formal training
for cast members who work with food on
topics including proper food handling,
storage and preparation, personal hygiene,
and sanitation requirements
Outside of parks and resorts, Disney-branded
food products, including promotions with food
service, are required to meet or exceed
applicable food safety laws, regulations, and
industry standards.
Safety in Our Communities
Disney's Wild About Safety global educational
program aims to improve familiesʼ awareness of
safety, health, and environmental issues through
storytelling. Timon and Pumbaa, from the
animated film The Lion King, are official spokes-
characters on a mission to share important safety
and health messages through illustrations on tip
cards, activity books, a dedicated resort television
channel, and other materials throughout our
theme parks and resorts worldwide.
Accessible Experiences
Our theme parks offer guests with disabilities
various tools and options. These have included
audio descriptions and Braille; tactile and
large-print maps and guides for guests with
visual or cognitive disabilities; assistive listening,
captioning, and sign language interpretation at
select shows for guests; quiet areas designed to
help guests with additional sensory needs; and
more. Each park shares accessibility information
on their site-specific website.

INFORMATION SECURITY
TC-IM-230a.2
Information security, including cybersecurity, is
an important aspect of operations as it protects
systems, networks, and programs from digital
attacks. The companyʼs information security
management system is designed to secure the
Disney Global Networkʼs digital environment as
we grow our businesses. Our information security
program continues to be informed by the
National Institute of Standards and Technology
Cybersecurity Framework and other recognized
information security frameworks, including the
core principles set forth therein.
The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors
reviews the companyʼs cybersecurity and data
security risks and mitigation strategies. Day-to-
day management of data security is the
responsibility of our Information & Data function,
which ultimately reports to our Chief Financial
Officer. This team periodically updates the Audit
Committee on the companyʼs cybersecurity risks
and mitigation strategies.

PRIVACY
TC-IM-220a.1
We have policies designed to enhance the
protection of the personal information of our
customers, guests, non-guests (including job
applicants and third-party businesses), and
our employees. Our global privacy program is
based on the principles of privacy by design,
accountability, transparency, and giving
individuals meaningful controls over their
personal information. We regularly assess and
update our program to take into account
applicable requirements of new privacy laws
and regulations around the world and to keep
up with rapid advancements in technology and
new business initiatives. In 2024, this included
working with people across the company to
implement evolving data protection requirements
across Europe, the UK, Latin America, Asia, and
the U.S. in support of business initiatives.
We provide privacy training to our employees
and have incorporated privacy topics into the
companyʼs Standards of Business Conduct and
information security trainings—both of which
are required on a recurring basis. We also
regularly conduct specialized trainings for
applicable employees on how to properly handle
the personal information of customers,
employees, contractors, and/or third parties.
Day-to-day management of data privacy policies
is the responsibility of our Global Public Policy &
Privacy function, which ultimately reports to our
Chief Legal & Compliance Officer.
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
Disney has a rich history at the intersection of
creativity and innovation—blending storytelling
and technology to bring imagination to life and
connect people to iconic characters, stories,
and brands. We embrace the promise of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a tool to benefit
our employees, customers, guests, and creators.
We are committed to using AI in a responsible,
human-centered, and ethical manner that
recognizes the value of human creativity,
respects intellectual property, and considers
our audiences.
We have established an AI governance process
that operates pursuant to a principle-based
framework. It is designed to identify business,
information integrity, human rights, privacy,
legal, and other risks associated with a proposed
use, as well as measures which can be employed
to satisfactorily mitigate them. The governance
model includes appropriate updates to executive
management and the Board. In addition, our use
of AI is subject to our generally applicable
governance practices and policies, such as our
Standards of Business Conduct, Privacy Policy,
Human Rights Policy, and relevant guild or
collective bargaining agreements.
Our use of AI currently falls into three
broad categories:
• Enhancing human-centered creative output
and storytelling capabilities
• Innovating around the guest experience
to more effectively meet the needs of
our customers
• Improving operational efficiency by
empowering our employees with AI tools that
help them do their jobs better and improve
their experience at the workplace
JOURNALISTIC INTEGRITY
SV-ME-270a.3
It is our responsibility to uphold the principles of
fairness and integrity as we gather and report the
news. Our journalists worldwide are expected to
approach their work with rigor, to question
thoroughly and skeptically, to analyze deeply,
and to adhere to a journalistic standard of ethics.
Our news operations and content are guided by
this dedication to high-quality journalism and
editorial integrity. This means a commitment to
fairness, compelling storytelling, and accuracy
across ABC News and ESPN.

COMPREHENSIVE TOTAL REWARDS
SV-HL-310a.3
To help attract and retain top talent, Disney
offers competitive total rewards that include pay,
health and savings benefits, time-off programs,
educational opportunities, and more. Together,
these rewards make up a comprehensive package
that empowers our employees and cast members
to grow personally and professionally, and to take
advantage of the special extras that only Disney
can provide. These include complimentary theme
park admission, a variety of discounts, and
complimentary access to our streaming services
for eligible employees.
Equitable Pay Commitment
Disney is committed to fostering a respectful and
equitable workplace culture. Our annual pay
ratio analysis is just one way we are striving to
meet that ongoing commitment. The pay ratio
analysis compares the base pay, bonus, and long-
term incentives of eligible U.S. employees based
on gender, race, and ethnicity. As of September
2024, the adjusted median pay ratio analysis,
which adjusted for factors such as role,
experience, and location, resulted in each pay
ratio at 99% or higher.
We also included an unadjusted median pay
ratio analysis for employees in the U.S., which
resulted in ratios at 84% or higher when not
adjusting for factors such as role, experience, and
location. While we disclose our annual pay ratios
on an adjusted and unadjusted basis, we believe
that the adjusted analysis is more meaningful
and consistent with the reporting of the largest
U.S. companies.
Wages For Hourly Employees
In 2024, almost all hourly full-time and part-
time employees within our U.S. Disney
Experiences business earned a base rate of $18/
hour or more, and median hourly earnings are
more than $21/hour.†
Pay Transparency
We recognize the importance of pay
transparency to our employees, shareholders,
and others, and are committed to helping our
employees and cast members understand our
pay practices, which we believe supports a
culture of understanding and trust. In fiscal
2024, we expanded our pay education resources
for leaders, included long-term incentive targets
on U.S. offer letters for candidates, and began to
display base pay ranges on total rewards
statements for a pilot group of U.S. employees.
Annual Bonus Plan
Disneyʼs Annual Bonus Plan is a discretionary
plan that recognizes eligible employees'
contributions towards business results. Generally,
eligibility includes our executives, management,
and certain professional roles. We updated our
fiscal 2024 Annual Bonus Plan performance
measures to reflect an increased emphasis on the
goals of our businesses and our ongoing
commitment to the employee experience.
Employee Benefits
Disneyʼs benefit offerings are designed to meet
the varied and evolving needs of our workforce
across businesses and geographies while
enabling employees and their loved ones to
thrive in their daily lives. In fiscal year 2024, we
amplified our focus on financial well-being by
adding a Student Debt Match component to the
U.S. 401(k) plan, as well as establishing new
International and U.S. retirement plans for
Disney Cruise Line crew members.

EMPLOYEE HEALTH
& WELL-BEING
We strive to provide a healthy and respectful
work environment where employees have
the support they need and the peace of mind
they deserve.
Mental Health
We offer a variety of in-person and virtual
resources to employees and their loved ones that
span a wide spectrum of care, from mindfulness,
meditation, and stress management tools and
programs to access to mental health care
providers. Our Employee Assistance Program
(EAP) is available to eligible employees and
their family/household members, providing
support and connecting participants directly to
licensed network therapists. Employees enrolled
in a Disney medical plan have access through
their plan to a range of behavioral health
resources that provide patient-centered care
from mental health professionals. In May 2024,
we launched a global Mental Health Awareness
Month celebration including a "Disney Day of
You," with immersive experiences at our
campuses around the world, designed to
spread awareness and reduce stigmas around
mental health.
Employee Well-Being
Disney offers well-being programs, tools, and
resources virtually and onsite for employees
around the world and in-person classes and
events at campus wellness centers. Employees
have access to a variety of on-demand well-
being apps and platforms to manage stress,
encourage movement, improve mindfulness and
sleep, and increase personal resiliency, as well as
access to on-demand, personalized financial
education. In fiscal 2024, Enterprise Benefits
worked closely with our Employee-Led Groups,
referred to as Belonging Employee Resource
Groups, to host educational events on key topics
such as menopause, cardiodiabesity, and financial
literacy, and continued to offer unique onsite
experiences, like our field days and 5k run/walk
events (shown below).
EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT
& INCLUSION
SV-ME-260a.1, TC-IM-330a.3
Disney is committed to engaging and inspiring
employees and creating a culture that is
welcoming and respectful of all. By connecting
employees to our brand and vision, we drive an
exceptional employee experience. Across Disney,
we purposefully build supportive environments
and champion a culture where everyone feels
like they belong, can flourish, and can make a
positive impact.
Onboarding New Talent
U.S.-based new hires attend a virtual and live
orientation experience that focuses on our
history and mission, strategic priorities, global
structure, and brand stewardship. They are
informed of the benefits, opportunities, and
unique only-at-Disney perks available to them as
Disney employees. Segments provide business-
specific orientation, either in person or virtually.
Listening To and Learning From Our
Employees
We are committed to listening to and
learning from employees across the enterprise,
sharing their stories, and incorporating their
valuable ideas and feedback. At the local level,
we use feedback to focus our team actions.
At the company level, employee insight helps
to identify and inform global initiatives to
enhance the employee experience and
employee well-being.
One way we listen to our employees is through
our Disney Employee Experience Survey. The
survey is sent to a sample of employees and cast
members each quarter, with every eligible
employee receiving at least one invitation
throughout the year. Nearly 80,000 employees
provided their input last year, with
representation from all business segments.
In fiscal 2024, we invested in our Disney
Employee Experience Survey to improve its
simplicity and impact. We refreshed the survey
content to be more succinct and targeted, and
focused on key outcomes of the employee
experience. We also increased the visibility of
survey results to employees in fiscal 2024, by
posting insights directly on the companyʼs
internal website.
Results from employee engagement activities,
including surveys, are regularly shared with
senior leadership and the Board.
Employee-Led Groups
Disney's Employee-Led Groups, referred to as
Belonging Employee Resource Groups,
strengthen our culture and community of
belonging. These voluntary groups are open to
all and provide employees with opportunities to
develop leadership skills, network, engage with
fellow employees, and participate in meaningful
community outreach and volunteer efforts. In
fiscal 2024, eight ESPN Belonging Employee
Resource Groups celebrated their 15-year
anniversaries and three Disney Experience
Belonging Employee Resource Groups
celebrated their 25-year anniversaries.

Recognizing Each Other
Outstanding work by our employees is
recognized in several ways. RecognizeNow! is a
worldwide digital platform that enables
employees to quickly and easily send notes of
appreciation, recognition, and gratitude to one
another. We also recognize employees, cast
members, crew members, and Imagineers for
their years of service with Service Celebration
events. These celebrations are held around the
globe throughout the year to recognize those
who have reached milestone anniversaries. In
addition, the CEO offers special recognition to
employees who have gone above and beyond to
make a material impact to the company,
including contributions to emergency response.
Supporting Our Employees With
Disabilities
We are committed to an inclusive and accessible
workplace. We are transparent about our
disability accommodations process, with
resources like tip guides, workshops, assistive
technology, and information in multiple
accessible formats. As an example, we are
working to increase the number of Connected
Spaces across global worksites. Connected
Spaces are designed to enhance productivity for
hybrid meetings and include several accessibility
features, like captioning on screens during video
calls. In fiscal 2024, many of our conference
rooms in domestic U.S., LATAM, EMEA, and APAC
Disney office locations were Connected Spaces.
† Disney VoluntEARS data includes hours logged by
Disney employees and are rounded.
Engaging Employees & Communities in
Social Impact
As part of our employee engagement efforts, we
encourage employee volunteering and create
special opportunities for employees and cast
members to participate in programs they
support. Since the Disney VoluntEARS program
began in 1983, our employees and cast
members have collectively contributed nearly
14 million† hours of service to their communities
worldwide. We match eligible employee and cast
member donations of money and time through
our U.S. Matching Gifts and international
donation amplification efforts, as well as Disney
VoluntEARS Grants programs.
Having a positive impact as we grow our
businesses has been a part of our company since
its founding. For example, Disney endeavors to
create moments of happiness for kids and
families when itʼs needed most through its wish
granting efforts and childrenʼs hospitals initiative.
As the worldʼs largest wish granter for Make-A-
Wish®
, Disney grants a wish every hour of every
day. Since the first official wish was granted at
Disneyland® Resort in 1981, Disney has granted
more than 165,000 magical wishes globally for
children with critical illnesses. Additionally, in
2018, Disney announced a global commitment
of $100 million to help reimagine the patient
experience in childrenʼs hospitals. We are happy
to announce that as of fiscal 2024, we have
fulfilled this commitment.

TALENT DEVELOPMENT
We reach and attract the best, most talented
people around the world. We believe that when
our workforce is drawn from the rich diversity
and lived experiences of our guests, customers,
and future consumers, we can better and more
authentically create entertainment that appeals
to a global audience. Expanding our pipeline of
talent includes strategic talent outreach and
engagement efforts, development programs, and
marketing roles on platforms that reach
potential candidates from a wide range of
sources. We offer optional learning experiences
to support leaders in identifying, attracting, and
engaging a multifaceted talent pool. And we
foster an accessible workplace to help attract
and support employees with disabilities.
As an equal opportunity employer, all decisions
regarding recruiting, hiring, promotion, training,
termination, and other conditions of employment
are made without unlawful discrimination on the
basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin,
age, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability,
veteran status, or other protected categories.
Growing Our Pipeline of Talent
To expand our reach for top talent, Disney builds
and nurtures relationships with various academic
institutions and nonprofit organizations to
enhance development opportunities for students
and talent that reflect the diversity of experience
we seek in our leadership and workforce. We
offer internship and apprenticeship programs
and host events in collaboration with
organizations focused on building long-term
pipelines of talent around the world.
Through our Disney on the Yard initiative, we
help to build a long-term pipeline of talent from
Historically Black Colleges and Universities
(HBCUs) and expand access to opportunities
within the entertainment industry. Additionally,
we continue to strengthen relationships through
recruitment outreach, development
opportunities, and industry engagement.
Disney develops and facilitates a range of
uniquely tailored talent development programs
designed to create access to impactful career
paths related to Disney's core businesses. As an
example, Disney Entertainment Televisionʼs
Entertainment Incubator Program provides an
apprentice-style, rotational experience for
individuals with a diversity of perspectives,
contributing to talent development across the
companyʼs television brands. We also work with
and recognize studios and organizations across
the film industry, like the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences and the British Film
Institute, that have adopted policies and
practices to broaden access and representation
in front of and behind the camera.

are designed to support our people, regardless of
where they are in their careers.
Disney employees around the globe have access
to both required training (e.g., Standards of
Business Conduct) and optional learning
opportunities. Offerings include self-directed
and instructor-led training, as well as in-person
courses. Employees have access to online
learning and development platforms that allow
them to search content tailored to their unique
needs and preferences.
Investing in Our People
Through Education
Disney offers education reimbursement to
salaried employees who are interested in
furthering their careers through professional and
technical education related to their current roles.
We also support the long-term career aspirations
of our hourly employees through a variety of
skill-based and education programs, including
Disney Aspire. We contribute upfront tuition
costs and reimbursement of expenses like books
and other fees for eligible participating
employees at a variety of in-network learning
providers and universities—ranging from high
school completion to undergraduate degrees.
Leadership Development
Throughout fiscal 2024, we continued to offer
our signature leadership development
experiences, including:
• Disney IGNITE, which empowers Disney
directors and vice presidents to develop
practical strategies for enhancing
collaboration and problem-solving. More than
1,300 executive leaders participated globally
throughout fiscal 2024
• Disney Leadership Essentials, our foundational
development experience for first-line leaders,
helps build core skills and cultivate
relationships that will accelerate their
contribution to the organizationʼs success.
2,600 leaders participated throughout
fiscal 2024
We continued to offer new leadership
development programs and experiences, including:
• The Executive Onboarding Resource Site,
which helps prepare newly-hired and newly-
promoted executives across the company for
success in their roles, and equips them with
tailored information and a variety of resources
• A scalable one-on-one coaching experience
was piloted as a tool for a more customized
and personalized method of leadership
development with BetterUp. We will continue
to offer this program in 2025 and beyond
Supporting Veterans in Our Workforce
We are honored to support active U.S. military,
veterans, and their families in many ways across
our company. Heroes Work Here, launched in
2012, is an innovative program committed to
hiring, training, and providing transitional
resources to U.S. military veterans and military
spouses while elevating awareness of their
significant contributions as civilian employees.

EMISSIONS FROM OUR DIRECT
OPERATIONS (SCOPE 1 & 2)
• Reduce absolute emissions from direct
operations (Scope 1 & 2) by 46.2%, against a
fiscal 2019 baseline
• Achieve net zero emissions for direct
operations‡
• Purchase or produce 100% zero carbon
electricity
• Invest in natural climate solutions
EMISSIONS FROM OUR VALUE CHAIN
(SCOPE 3)
• Reduce Scope 3 emissions through absolute
reduction and supplier and licensee
engagement:
– Reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions from
purchased goods and services, capital goods,
fuel- and energy-related activities, upstream
transportation and distribution, waste generated
in operations, business travel, employee
commuting, and franchises by a minimum of
27.5% against a fiscal 2019 baseline
– Commit that 20% of our suppliers, measured by
emissions covering purchased goods and
services, will have science-based targets by
2027
– Commit that 72% of our licensees, measured by
emissions covering franchises, will have science-
based targets by 2027
Disney has had a long-term goal to achieve net
zero‡ greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from our
direct operations (Scope 1 and 2) since 2009. As
of the end of fiscal 2024, the company has a
Science-Based Target to reduce Scope 1, 2, and 3
emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, and a
goal to achieve net-zero emissions from our
direct operations (Scope 1 and 2), by 2030.
38%
Progress toward reducing our
absolute Scope 1 and 2
emissions in support of our
2030 target, as of the end of
fiscal 2024
† Our environmental goal-setting process adapts to changes in our businesses and in relevant protocols that we follow. For emissions, we measure actual
emissions and forecast future emissions based on information available within our business plans, and on sectoral changes, process changes, and other
factors. We expect to follow SBTi methodology recommendations that companies use to check the validity of their target projections annually, and, at a
minimum, reassess targets every five years.

Examples of Using Our Five Key Levers to Work Toward Our 2030
Emissions Target for Direct Operations (Scope 1 & 2):
Sustainable Design
Our new building at 7 Hudson Square in New York City includes all-
electric heating and cooling systems; on-site solar panels; high-
efficiency, dedicated, outside air systems; high-performance facade;
waste heat recovery systems; and water source and air source electric
heat pumps.
Energy Efficiency
Hong Kong Disneyland Resort received the Carbon Management
Grand Award as part of the 2024 CLP Smart Energy Award,
organized by CLP Power Hong Kong Limited, for its commitment
to energy efficiency and outstanding performance in carbon
reduction. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort utilizes digital twin
modeling for its cooling systems, which helps predict electricity
demand and achieve energy savings.
Electrification
In fiscal 2024, Disneyland Resort developed a fleet electrification
strategy that optimizes the use of fleet and EV chargers. As of the end
of fiscal 2024, approximately 10% of the fleet has been electrified,
and the first fleet-dedicated EV charging depot has been installed.
Nearly 440 electric vehicle charging stations across the property
have been installed, serving the needs of guests, cast, and fleet.
Zero-Carbon Electricity
In collaboration with local utility providers at Walt Disney World®
Resort, a new 75-megawatt solar array came online in fiscal 2024.
This array brings the site's renewable electricity use up to 25% of its
total electricity consumption.
Lower Carbon Fuels
Disney Cruise Line (DCL) invests in alternative fuels, such as
Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO).
DCL is also researching alternative fuels, such as bio-LNG, green
methanol, and other fuel sources to support their development at
scale in the maritime industry.

Reducing Scope 3 Emissions and
Engaging Suppliers and Licensees
Recognizing the complex challenge of achieving
our Scope 3 GHG emissions targets, we have
collaborated extensively across the company to
develop our pathway and identify levers for a
Scope 3 emissions reduction journey.
Strategies to reduce our broader value chain
emissions include: working with strategic
suppliers to increase operational efficiency and
the adoption of renewable energy; exploring less
carbon-intensive materials for our products and
productions; employing sustainable design in
new buildings; identifying climate-friendly food
and beverage options; and exploring additional
employee commuting programs. In fiscal 2024,
through a capacity-building program, we
collaborated with the consultancy firm
Guidehouse, through the Supplier Leadership on
Climate Transition program, to help 40 of our
higher emitting suppliers and licensees develop
their own emissions reduction targets in
alignment with the latest guidance from SBTi.
While we develop and implement our value
chain decarbonization strategies, we will
continue to improve our data collection and
reporting methodologies.
Like most companies setting aspirational Scope 3
targets, these are challenging goals, and success
is not guaranteed. Achieving our target will
depend on several external factors, including
global policies toward clean energy solutions,
actions by our suppliers to reduce their emissions,
global economy-wide transitions to cleaner fuels,
the availability of economically feasible solutions
at scale, and consumer behavioral changes.
We follow global frameworks to
measure Scope 1, 2, & 3 GHG emissions:

WATER
2030 Water Goals
• Implement localized watershed
stewardship strategies
• Source sustainable seafood†
Water is a highly localized issue, and our
strategy incorporates individualized
considerations in each geography. We continue
to implement site-specific water strategies at our
high-impact sites, including our global parks and
corporate campuses.
Watershed Stewardship
We have performed regional water studies and
continue to collaborate with local stakeholders,
including nonprofits, to promote the overall
health of regional watersheds. In fiscal 2024, we
supported a project in The Bahamas with The
Nature Conservancy to help protect coastal
communities by reducing the impacts of storm
surge and flooding.
Water Conservation
We remain committed to implementing water
conservation measures across our operations.
During production on 20th Century Studios'
Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, which was
released in fiscal 2024, the special effects team
was able to use, and then recycle, water needed
for filming. They sourced 60,000 liters of water
that was treated and returned to the Sydney,
Australia, water system after filming concluded.
Sustainable Seafood
Responsibly selecting and sourcing seafood is an
important aspect of our commitment to protect
the health of our oceans. In fiscal 2024, our U.S.
parks, U.S. resorts, and cruise line sourced 96%
sustainable seafood.†
† Disneyʼs definition of sustainable seafood can be found in our 2030 Environmental Goals White Paper. The breakdown of sustainable seafood in
fiscal 2024 was 6% Best Choice, 70% Eco-certified, 5% Good Alternative, 4% Avoid, 15% Fishery Improvement Projects, and 1% Unrated.

Our long-term waste management plan includes
reducing single-use and other plastic; reducing
waste on our properties, including food waste;
reusing products and materials; being deliberate
about material sourcing; maximizing recycling;
and educating our guests and employees.
59%
Total operational waste diverted
from landfill and incineration for
owned and operated Disney Parks
and Cruise Lines in fiscal 2024
Reducing Single-Use Plastics
A key step in reducing single-use plastics is
understanding where they are used. During fiscal
2024, both Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney
World Resort conducted their first full inventory
of key single-use plastics used in their business
operations. This plastics inventory includes food
and beverage items like beverage containers, to-
go ware, and utensils; in-room hotel amenities;
and merchandise bags. In fiscal 2023, the sites
purchased a combined more than 4,000 tons of
single-use plastic across these categories.‡
We are committed to reducing single-use
plastics in our parks, resorts, and experiences.
We offer reusable dishware options at 116
food and beverage locations, and increasingly
choose certified, wood-based cutlery over plastic,
offering them in 22% of locations in fiscal 2024.

Sit-down restaurants at Walt Disney World
Resort now offer reusable kids cups and
Disneyland Paris switched single-use dinnerware
to reusable cups, plates, and utensils in all of
their major restaurants. Hong Kong Disneyland
Resort made progress by reducing single-use
plastic hotel amenities, offering them by request
only. Disneyland Resort is implementing a
campus approach to installing bulk condiment
stations that will reduce single-use plastic and
food waste in restaurants.
Disney Cruise Line (DCL) continues to build
upon past progress in eliminating all non-
essential, single-use plastic. In 2023, DCL
purchased 29 tons of plastic on their ships under
the categories of food and beverage and hotel
amenities and aim to eliminate all guest-facing,
single-use plastic by the end of fiscal 2025.‡ To
date, DCL has eliminated plastic to-go ware,
utensils, water bottles, single-use amenity
bottles, and merchandise bags across the fleet. In
addition, DCL continues to purchase in bulk,
where possible, in order to reduce packaging
waste and requests non-plastic packaging
options from suppliers, where available.
† Zero waste to landfill is defined as 90% operational waste diversion, including thermal waste-to-energy for Walt Disney World Resort, Disneyland Resort, Disneyland Paris, and Disney Cruise Line.
‡ The single-use plastics inventory excludes the following items: bulk containers, novelty items, multi-material containers, and items purchased by third-party operators.

2030 Materials Goals for
Disney-Branded Products
• Paper will contain 100% recycled content
or lower impact alternatives for products
and packaging
• Wood will contain 100% recycled content
or lower impact alternatives for products
and packaging
• Palm oils used as an ingredient in Disney-
branded products will be from certified sources
• Textiles used in Disney-branded products
will be from recycled content or lower
impact alternatives
• Plastic in products and packaging will
contain at least 30% recycled content or
lower impact alternatives
• Packaging will be designed for reuse,
recycling, or composting
• Facilities that manufacture Disney-branded
products will maintain a Higg Facility
Environmental Module (FEM) or Disney-
approved manufacturing assessment
Our materials goals focus on reducing the
environmental impacts of high-volume or high-
impact materials in our consumer products
business, while also helping our manufacturing
network become cleaner and safer. Collaboration
with suppliers is underway to test and scale
innovative material solutions, focusing on
enabling commercially viable advancements and
bringing these changes to life.
A key component of our work toward these goals
is the use of a Disney-approved manufacturing
certification or assessment, such as the Higg
FEM. The Higg FEM assessment serves as a
foundational tool for understanding
environmental impacts within facilities that
manufacture Disney-branded products. In
calendar 2024, more than 70% of facilities
utilized by vendors† completed the Higg FEM.
In 2024, we continued our efforts to source
sustainable materials and recycled plastics for
our products and packaging. We launched
Create Your Own plush headbands, in which all
plush attachments contain 100% recycled
content stuffing. We followed a similar approach
for three Tianaʼs Bayou Adventure Critters plush
toys and nine Inside Out 2 plush toys, which all
contain 100% recycled content stuffing.
Combined, these efforts represent 6.8 metric
tons of recycled content and 8.8 metric tons of
potential carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions avoided.
In order to assess environmentally-preferred
choices made at the product level, we are
currently investing in programs and software that
can quantitatively track the progress of our
consumer products business against the
companyʼs environmental goals. These systems
are expected to be rolled out by the end of
calendar 2025.
SUSTAINABLE DESIGN
2030 Sustainable
Design Goals
• Design new projects to achieve near net zero
GHG emissions,‡ maximize water efficiency,
and support zero waste operations§
• Achieve 90% diversion of construction waste
across new projects in the U.S. and Europe
Disneyʼs sustainable design strategy enables us
to plan, build, and operate our facilities while
minimizing emissions, water, and waste. As our
businesses grow and new assets are built, we
follow a set of internal Sustainable Design
Standards that are aligned with our 2030 goals.
We worked to reduce our impacts on the
environment throughout the design,
construction, and operation of Disney Lookout
Cay at Lighthouse Point, Disney Cruise Line's
newest island destination in The Bahamas, which
welcomed guests for the first time in 2024. For
example, up to 90% of the expected electricity
demand for the island destination has been
designed to be met by on-site solar panels,
equipped with battery storage. The site uses a
reclaimed water system for irrigation, washdown,
and flushing within its facilities. and features an
innovative, open-trestle pier which extends to
deep waters and prevented the dredging of a
ship channel.
Our new state-of-the-art complex in New York
City (shown below), which opened in fiscal
2024, has been designed to meet and exceed
Disney's 2030 Environmental Goals. The
building is on track to receive two LEED
Platinum certifications in 2025—one for New
Construction Core and Shell, and one for Interior
—the highest level of certification from the U.S.
Green Building Council.
Newly constructed Disney Vacation Club
cabins at Disneyʼs Fort Wilderness Resort in
Walt Disney World Resort, were designed with
sustainability in mind and opened to guests
in summer 2024. The cabins were built on
the existing land footprint with original cabin
materials salvaged for reuse or recycling.
Our pre-fabrication strategy minimized waste
during construction. The new cabins will be
60% more efficient than the baseline design.
They incorporate a heat reflective roof, high-
efficiency HVAC units, LED lighting, and include
electric vehicle charging. Landscaping at the
new cabins uses native vegetation and does not
require irrigation.

† Only includes facilities utilized by in-scope vendors to manufacture Disney-branded products for U.S. Disney stores, U.S. Theme Park Merchandise, and Disneystore.com. The Higg Index is a suite of tools for the measurement of value chain sustainability. The Higg Facility Environmental Module (Higg FEM) tool
assesses environmental impacts of product manufacturing at facilities.

NATURE
Disneyʼs commitment to conservation began with
Walt Disney himself. Our efforts to help protect
nature and wildlife globally continue to this day
through our 2030 goals, philanthropic
investments, dedicated expert teams and
programs, and inspirational storytelling.
Disney Conservation
Since 1995, Disney has invested more than
$132 million through the Disney Conservation
Fund (DCF), a company initiative that supports
community-based solutions to protect wildlife
and their habitats. In fiscal 2024, DCF invested
more than $7.6 million in grants to support
nonprofit organizations working on the ground in
nearly 30 countries. This included recognizing
Dr. Jane Goodallʼs 90th birthday with a
contribution to Jane Goodall's Roots & Shoots
youth-led action program and making additional
grants that recognize trailblazing women in
conservation globally.
For the release of Disneynatureʼs Tiger, Disney
awarded a grant to the Wildlife Conservation
Society to support their initiatives to safeguard
the world's most endangered tigers. Other
investments made through DCF supported the
creation and restoration of habitats in Shanghai
and France, empowered students through
environmental education in Türkiye and the U.S.,
and expanded The Great Reef Census, a global
marine conservation effort.

Caring For Animals and the Environment
Disneyʼs Animals, Science and Environment team
leads the companyʼs efforts to care for animals,
connect people with animals and nature through
immersive experiences and storytelling, and
conserve our natural resources. The team
introduced cutting-edge radio frequency
identification (RFID) technology to help track
and better care for the birds in our aviaries in
fiscal 2024.
Celebrating Earth Month and OurHOME
In April 2024, we elevated stories to inspire
action to protect, restore, and celebrate our
planet. The ourHOME campaign featured
compelling, earth-related content on a range of
Disney channels and streaming services,
including the release of National Geographic's
award-winning Secrets of the Octopus
documentary series and Disneynature's all-new
feature film, Tiger.

OVERVIEW
We believe disclosure frameworks are helpful in providing our stakeholders with relevant and decision-
useful information. As such, we regularly monitor existing and emerging frameworks to inform our
sustainability practices and reporting. We measure year-over-year performance of certain metrics and
include responses to select third-party, voluntary reporting framework indicators to help our
stakeholders find the information that is important to them. We recognize third-party frameworks are
quickly evolving, and we are evaluating which frameworks and disclosures will be helpful to
stakeholders in the future.
As it relates to fiscal 2024, we currently align our disclosures to the following frameworks: the
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards (now part of the International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation), the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure
(TCFD), and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

General
1. Disneyʼs fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to
September 30.
Environmental Sustainability
2. Some previously published environmental data has been
restated to reflect corrections, updates to methodology,
and/or changes in emission factors.
3. GHGs are measured and calculated according to the
principles in the World Resources Institute and the
World Business Council for Sustainable Development
Greenhouse Gas Protocolʼs “A Corporate Accounting
and Reporting Standard, 2004 Revised Edition”
(GHG Protocol).
4. The boundary for Disneyʼs GHG emissions reporting
includes owned and operated assets (such as theme
parks and resorts, Disney Cruise Line, and commercial
spaces), leased assets (such as office locations), as well
as Productions (including feature films, television,
theatricals, and sporting events). Direct CO2 emissions
from biogenic fuels are not included in the Scope 1
totals. They are as follows: Fiscal 2020: 16,799 MT
CO2e; Fiscal 2021: 22,662 MT CO2e; Fiscal 2022: 4,890
MT CO2e; Fiscal 2023: 36,393 MT CO2e; Fiscal 2024:
46,526 MT CO2e.
5. A third-party validator has provided limited assurance
of our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions since fiscal 2019,
and Scope 3 GHG emissions for fiscal 2019, 2022,
and 2023. Please see the “Document Center” at the
bottom of our ESG Reporting website for Emissions
Verification statements.
6. We define “net emissions” and “net zero emissions” for
our 2030 goals as follows: Scope 1 emissions plus Scope
2 emissions (market-based) minus carbon credits.
Market-based emissions are used where available in
calculating carbon credit retirements, total emissions,
and net emissions. Scope 2 emissions (market-based)
include emission reductions attributed to utility green
power purchases, power purchase agreements, and
unbundled energy attribute certificates. Our approach to
carbon credits can be found in our Natural Climate
Solutions White Paper. We will have achieved our 2030
“net zero emissions” goal when “net emissions,” as
defined above, equals 0.
7. Carbon credits are from projects developed according to
recognized standards (e.g., Climate Action Reserve,
Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard) and are
retired annually. All credits are verified by accredited
third-party reviewers.
8. Scope 3 emissions calculations follow guidance provided
by the GHG Protocol. In many instances, these emissions
calculations are based on estimated and extrapolated
data and rely on third-party emission factor databases
and industry averages. We expect to make continual
improvements to Scope 3 estimates over time, including
updates to assessments of business activities and activity
boundaries, and improvements in input data and
emission factors. As a result of current data availability,
methodologies, and business processes, the most recent
Scope 3 emissions data are reported for the previous
fiscal year (and thus are reported for fiscal 2023 as the
most recent available data for this report). Scope 3
emissions are part of Disneyʼs science-based target that
was validated by SBTi. In order to monitor progress
against this target, fiscal year 2019 is used as the
baseline year; data for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 will
not be reported.
9. Spend-based methodology estimates emissions for
goods and services by collecting data on the economic
value of goods and services purchased and multiplying
that by relevant secondary (e.g., industry average)
emission factors (e.g., average emissions per monetary
value of goods).
10. Hybrid methodology uses a combination of supplier-
specific activity and/or emission data (where available)
and secondary data to fill the gaps.
11. Average data methodology estimates emissions for
goods and services by collecting data on the mass (e.g.,
kilograms or pounds) or other relevant units of goods or
services purchased, and multiplying by the relevant
secondary (e.g., industry average) emission factors (e.g.,
average emissions per unit of good or service).
12. Average product methodology involves estimating
emissions for goods by collecting data on the mass or
other relevant units of goods purchased and multiplying
by relevant secondary (e.g., industry average) emission
factors (e.g., average emissions per unit of good).
13. Fuel-based methodology involves determining the
amount of fuel consumed (i.e., Scope 1 and 2 emissions
of transport providers) and applying the appropriate
emission factor for that fuel.
14. Distance-based methodology involves determining the
mass, distance, and mode of each transportation activity,
then applying the appropriate vehicle-distance, mass-
distance, or passenger-distance emission factor for the
vehicle used.
15. Waste-type specific methodology involves using
emission factors for specific waste types and waste
treatment methods.
16. Emissions within this category were evaluated and
determined not to be relevant. Activities identified as
downstream transportation and distribution do not result
in significant Scope 3 emissions for the company.
17. Emissions within this category were evaluated and
determined not to be relevant. The company does
not have any activities that it characterizes as
intermediate goods.
18. Site-specific methodology involves identifying site-
specific fuel and electricity, and applying the appropriate
emission factors.
19. Franchise-specific methodology involves collecting site-
specific activity data or Scope 1 and 2 emissions data
from franchisees.
20. Asset-specific methodology involves collecting asset-
specific (e.g., site-specific) fuel and energy use data, or
Scope 1 and 2 emissions data from individual assets.
21. Total energy includes electricity, natural gas, chilled
water, hot water, steam, compressed air, renewable
energy, and fuels. Fiscal 2020 and 2021 data exclude
energy from Productions.
22. Percentage grid electricity is purchased electricity
consumption divided by total energy consumption.
23. We define zero carbon electricity as any type of
electricity generation that does not generate GHGs, such
as solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear, and large-scale
hydropower. Percentage zero carbon electricity is zero
carbon electricity consumption divided by total
electricity consumption.

24. Percentage renewables is renewable energy
consumption divided by total energy consumption.
Renewable energy consumed includes renewable fuels
and renewable electricity that we produce or purchase
and match with Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) or
Guarantees of Origin (GOs). The renewable portion of
the electricity grid mix, for which we do not possess
RECs or GOs, is not included in this calculation.
25. Waste diverted includes waste prevention, donations,
recycling, compost, anaerobic digestion, and thermal
waste-to-energy. Total waste generated includes
diverted waste, waste sent to landfill, and incineration
without energy recovery. Incineration without energy
recovery is not counted in total waste sent to landfill or
total waste diverted—thus the two do not sum to total
waste generated.
26. For total company operational waste data, facilities
include theme parks and resorts, Disney Cruise Line,
ESPN, enterprise-owned commercial and office spaces,
and Pixar. Excluded are all leased properties, Disney
Stores and Distribution Centers, TV stations, and all
construction materials.
27. The boundary for this metric is Walt Disney World
Resort, Disneyland Resort, Disneyland Paris, and Disney
Cruise Line.
28. The boundary for Disneyʼs water consumption includes
owned and operated assets (theme parks and resorts,
Disney Cruise Line, owned commercial and office spaces,
Studios, and ESPN). Water consumption from Disney
Stores and leased assets is excluded. Water data for
Shanghai Disney Resort were not included in data prior
to fiscal 2021.
29. Construction diversion rate includes data from annual
facility asset planning construction projects and
construction for new assets that became operational in
the reporting year, in the U.S. and Europe only.
30. Only includes facilities utilized by vendors to
manufacture Disney-branded products for U.S. Disney
stores, U.S. Theme Park Merchandise, and
disneystore.com. The Higg Index is a suite of tools for
the measurement of value chain sustainability. The Higg
FEM tool assesses environmental impacts of product
manufacturing at facilities.
Workforce & Representation
31. Employee statistics generally reflect our employment
base at the end of each fiscal year.
32. Headcount excludes dailies, freelancers, contractors, and
domestic Disney employees not paid in the last 60 days.
33. Employee numbers are rounded to the nearest thousand.
34. Learning-related data are approximate and rounded.
Data reflect courses offered through our top learning
platforms: D Learn, Harvard Spark, Harvard
ManageMentor, and Harvard Leading Edge. D Learn data
represent all employees, excluding Pixar, and contract
workers for all years, and Hulu employees prior to fiscal
2021. Data incorporates both required and non-required
courses, including online courses, orientations, in-person
classes, and on-demand content. Participants can attend
more than one course and may view online content more
than once, depending on their individual needs.
35. Data represent the number of unique courses offered.
Prior to fiscal 2022, this metric measured the number of
scheduled classes of a unique course. Methodology was
updated to better reflect unique courses offered vs.
courses consumed.
36. Almost all hourly full-time and part-time, non-tipped
employees in our U.S. Disney Experiences business earn
a base rate of at least $18/hour, excluding the value of
benefits for eligible employees. This metric excludes
Walt Disney World College Program participants (this
program is not comparable to other employment
opportunities, as it includes other benefits such as
housing and transportation), Disney Stores in select
regions, and temporary daily hires. All employees earn
minimum wage or higher. Median earnings for hourly
employees are based on total earnings for total hours
paid and includes the impact of overtime, shift
premiums, and gratuities. Excludes the value of benefits
for eligible employees.
37. Headcount not reported in Women includes Men,
Nonbinary (where collected), and Non-Disclosed.
38. Headcount includes full-time and part-time employees,
and excludes dailies, freelancers, contractors, casual
seasonal, interns, and domestic TWDC employees not
paid in the last 60 days. Domestic counts exclude Disney
Cruise Line Shipboard. Percentages for Women based on
global full- and part-time headcount. Percentages for
People of Color include U.S.-based full- and part-time
employees only. People of Color includes employees
who are Asian American, Black or African American,
Hispanic or Latino, American Indian or Alaska Native,
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, or Two or
More Races.
39. “Executive” includes employees at the Director level and
above. “Manager” includes employees at Manager
levels. “Below Manager” includes employees that do not
meet Executive or Manager criteria. In fiscal 2021 and
prior, Twenty-First Century Fox (TFCF) Directors were
included in Manager.
40. Due to rounding, total may not equal exactly 100%.
Consistent with our current disclosures, gender is
reported on a global basis and race and ethnicity is
reported for the U.S., in line with the EEO-1 race and
ethnicity categories. “Not Disclosed/Not Captured”
reflects employees who did not select any ethnicity or
selected “I wish not to answer.” Due to the unique
nature of our Frontline Operations businesses and roles,
including the frequent and variable movement of cast
members between such roles and how such movement is
tracked, our Frontline Operations hiring and retention
data are presented separately. Upward changes in job
level from a Frontline Operations role into a non-
frontline role are captured in the promotions data for
the non-Frontline Operations workforce.
Social Impact
41. Charitable cash contributions include company-directed
charitable cash donations, which includes contributions
made by the Disney Conservation Fund, as well as
employee-directed Matching Gifts grants and Disney
VoluntEARS Grants.
42. In-kind support refers to non-cash contributions
comprising tangible items or non-tangible support.
Donations may include, but are not limited to, estimated
values for merchandise, theme park tickets, food, public
service announcements (PSAs), character/talent
appearances, and other non-cash charitable support. Due
to differences in distribution, viewership, programming,
availability, pricing, marketplace demand, and other
variables, PSAs are valued differently across our media
platforms. For example, in some cases, PSAs are valued
based on an average sales price for the time period. In
other cases, the value is based on an average sponsor
value across a day part rotation. Therefore, we do not
use a single method to value PSAs.
Supply Chain
43. The supply chain for Disney-branded products
experiences routine fluctuations in active facilities. In any
given year, a significant number of new facilities may
become authorized to produce Disney-branded products,
which complicates any year-to-year comparison. In fiscal
2024, the facility count shown includes approximately
2,000 suppliers beyond Tier 1 that are subject to the
purview of the Disney International Labor Standards
(ILS) program.
44. Facility footprint data includes all facilities authorized to
manufacture Disney-branded products at any point
during the fiscal year. With respect to TFCF intellectual
property, as contracts are newly executed, renewed, or
amended, with respect to the manufacturing of products,
the facilities producing such goods fall under the
purview of the Disney ILS Program, and are included in
the facility footprint data. Aggregate facility data and
country facility data are approximate and rounded.
45. Disney uses the World Bankʼs Governance Indicators as
the primary resource for identifying and comparing areas
of risk and determining where to focus our monitoring
resources and requirements. Please refer to our
Permitted Sourcing Countries Policy.
46. Fiscal 2023 and 2024 supplier audit data includes
suppliers beyond Tier 1. Fiscal years prior to 2023
included only Tier 1 suppliers. The Disney ILS Program
works toward ongoing and sustainable improvement in
working conditions at facilities producing Disney-
branded products. All Code of Conduct violations
identified in active facilities as the result of audits or
assessments must be corrected or remediated within the
time periods and in the manner established by the Disney
ILS Program as a condition of continued use of the
facility for the production of Disney-branded products.
Healthy Living
47. Healthy Living licensing results do not include TFCF
businesses prior to fiscal 2022.

supply chain
• (1, 2) Supply chain assessments identify the most common risks to be in the areas of health and safety, overtime hours, and social
benefits; see Fiscal 2024 Data Table & Data Table Footnotes, pp. 33, 35. We understand that supply chain assessments may not fully
capture some underreported issues, such as sexual harassment, forced labor, and interference with freedom of association. We continue
to explore additional methods for gaining such visibility. Our supply chain policy commitments are described in our ILS Program Manual,
