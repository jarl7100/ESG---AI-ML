Introduction Our Planet Food Quality & Sourcing Jobs, Inclusion & Empowerment Community Connection Appendix
A Message From Our CEO
This past year, our focus remained
firmly on serving our customers
and communities – and I’m proud of
the positive impact the McDonald’s
System is making around the world.
Ray Kroc used to say, “We have an obligation
to give something back to the community that
gives so much to us.” This sentiment was even
more meaningful this past year, as the world
experienced a humanitarian crisis caused by the
wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, along with
the devastating natural disasters that plagued
many regions.
At the same time, many consumers are feeling
a strain on their wallets as a result of the volatile
environment. Despite these challenges, I’m
confident that we’re moving with urgency to
deliver great value for our customers while
showing up for the communities we serve.
In moments like these, I’m reminded of the sheer
impact of the McDonald’s System. We have the
power to transform our business and impact the
world around us. And we do so, as we always have,
energized by our values and our purpose: to feed
and foster communities.
Building Resilience Through
Climate Action
As a leading global brand, we understand our
responsibility to help preserve our planet so our
business and future generations can continue
to thrive. To protect the future of McDonald’s, we
need to help protect our Earth’s natural resources
so that we can continue serving our communities.
We’re making progress toward our commitment
to reach net zero emissions by 2050. This
includes working with suppliers to help
eliminate deforestation from our global supply
chain, adopting and scaling more sustainable
agricultural practices, reducing waste and
transitioning to more sustainable packaging.
Fostering Inclusion
At our core, McDonald’s is a people business.
Guided by our values, we’re committed
to fostering inclusive workplaces. We are
currently taking actions to create the type of
environment where people want to work by
investing in our people through professional
development opportunities, further preparing
them for a long career with us, and providing a
holistic employee value proposition. This is in
part accomplished through our Global Brand
Standards, which are already helping to promote
even safer workplaces.
Serving Our Communities
Every day, the McDonald’s System strives to
fulfill our purpose of feeding and fostering
communities locally, and there’s no greater
example of this dedication to drive positive
impact than our work with Ronald McDonald
House Charities (RMHC). In 2023, McDonald’s
Corporation donated $20 million as part of our
five-year, $100 million commitment. This year,
we join RMHC in celebrating 50 years of impact
for families with children who are sick. We are
inspired by the work that has been done – and will
continue – to support families around the world.

Alongside our world-class Franchisees, we have
also worked to reduce barriers to employment
for 2.2 million young people in communities
around the world by providing training programs
and employment opportunities – exceeding our
target goal two years ahead of schedule.
Looking Toward the Future
As we look to the future, I’m confident that we
will continue making a positive impact on local
communities around the world. By leveraging
our global scale and leading with purpose
today, we will continue to make a difference for
the generations of tomorrow. I look forward to
seeing us do that – in a way that only McDonald’s
can – through the collective strength of
our System.
Chris Kempczinski
President and CEO, McDonald’s Corporation
“
McDonald’s has a legacy of
delivering strategies that achieve
impact at scale for both people
and the planet. It’s a legacy we’re
extremely proud of and one we
share with all our stakeholders
through active engagement and
a history of honest, transparent
reporting. I’m inspired by the
work we do, every day, to feed
and foster communities, and
look forward to helping steer
the future of sustainability
at McDonald’s. ”
Beth Hart
Chief Sustainability & Social Impact Officer
A Message From Jon Banner,
Executive Vice President and
Global Chief Impact Officer,
McDonald’s Corporation
Every day, I continue to be impressed by
the positive impact that all three legs
of the stool are making. McDonald’s is
positioned to use our voice to help influence
positive change around the world. Our
business resilience strategy helps us ensure
this impact lasts while protecting our ability
to operate and serve communities in the
future. To achieve our purpose, we know that
we need to continue putting our people first.
And with over 2 million employees working
under the Arches, we’re advancing our efforts
to promote safe, respectful, and inclusive
workplaces. As of the end of 2023, our Global
Brand Standards, aimed at protecting the
physical and psychological safety of all our
people are in place across more than 41,000
locations worldwide.
Additionally, we’re partnering with non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) to help
us progress on our social impact efforts.
For example, by working closely with the
Business Advisory Group on Migration, and
through our work with the International
Youth Foundation (IYF), we’re helping
reduce barriers to employment and open
new avenues for positive change. We’re
collaborating with the right people to
ensure that we’re using our scale to make a
difference around the world.
As we look to the future, I'm filled
with enthusiasm for what lies ahead.
The challenges our world faces are
significant, but so is our determination to
be a force for good. We're not just adapting
to change – we’re helping to drive it, with a
clear vision of a more sustainable, equitable
and resilient future.
I’m so proud our System’s collective
progress to reach our goals and set targets.
Working together, we will continue to help
make a positive impact on our people and
our planet, every day.

Introduction Our Planet Food Quality & Sourcing Jobs, Inclusion & Empowerment Community Connection Appendix
Who We Are
What began as a small drive-in
restaurant in San Bernardino,
California, has grown into a
global icon that proudly serves
millions of customers every
day around the world.
While much has changed over the last six
decades, Ray Kroc’s original commitment to
Quality, Service, Cleanliness and Value has
endured and made McDonald’s a trusted
favorite for nearly 70 years.
McDonald’s restaurants, whether franchised
or operated by the Company, serve a
locally relevant menu of quality food and
beverages in communities across more
than 100 countries. Of the more than
41,000 McDonald’s restaurants at year-end
2023, approximately 95% were franchised.
Our continued commitment to our
Accelerating the Arches strategy is keeping
us relevant to our customers, through a
focus on marketing, our core menu and the
customer experience.
Our Growth Pillars
Marketing
Staying connected to what
our customers love about us
and bringing that emotion
into our creative.
Core
Our core menu remains
our competitive advantage
and a strength that we are
capitalizing on to grow share.
Digital, Delivery, Drive-Thru
and Development (“4-Ds”)
We will continue to expand
our loyalty program to power
personalized experiences while
getting closer to our customers by
accelerating the development of
new locations.
We’re also using technology to leverage the
full strength of our scale through consumer,
restaurant and company platforms.
What matters to our customers matters to
McDonald’s, so our vision – now and in the future
– centers on five core values: Serve, Inclusion,
Integrity, Community and Family. These values
form the backbone of our brand and support our
mission to make delicious feel-good moments
easy for everyone; living them is the foundation of
McDonald’s next great chapter.
Behind our Golden Arches is a global community
of crew, farmers, suppliers, Franchisees and
countless others who make up who we are
as a brand. People are at the cornerstone of
our business and are an essential part of the
McDonald’s System. Company employees, who
include those in our corporate and other offices
as well as in Company-owned and operated
restaurants, totaled over 150,000 worldwide as of
year-end 2023, of which approximately 70% were
based outside of the U.S. In addition to Company
employees, the more than 2 million individuals who
work in McDonald’s franchised restaurants around
the world are critical to our success, enabling the
Company to drive long-term value creation and
further its purpose and mission.
As the consumer landscape shifts, we are using
our competitive advantages to further strengthen
our brand. Our growth pillars build on our strong
foundations to help ensure we can meet the
moment today and have long-term success.
We’re committed to helping improve the lives of our
people, our industry and the planet by putting our
customers and employees first, sourcing quality
food, helping to reduce waste and contributing to
employment opportunities around the world.
We believe we have a responsibility to take on some
of the most pressing challenges of our time, and we
embrace this opportunity to lead by example and
create meaningful change.
The Company’s
Five Core Values
1 Serve – We put our customers
and people first.
2 Inclusion – We open our doors to everyone.
3 Integrity – We do the right thing.
4 Community – We are good neighbors.
5 Family – We get better together.

Introduction Our Planet Food Quality & Sourcing Jobs, Inclusion & Empowerment Community Connection Appendix
Our Impact Strategy
& Approach
We believe we have a
responsibility to ensure
long-term, sustainable value
creation by taking action
on the environmental and
social issues that are most
important to our stakeholders
and business.
We also believe effectively managing our
environmental and social impact is part
of operating our business responsibly.
By doing so, we aim to maximize shared
value, ensure trust in our brand and build
long-term resiliency.
Our Impact Areas and Goals
In 2020, we announced our Impact Strategy,
centered on four Impact Areas. These were
informed by feedback from stakeholders
and designed to help us make a difference at
scale and drive industrywide change. We have
established strategies, policies, goals and
performance indicators to measure and manage
annual progress and report against each area.
How We Prioritize Impact Areas
We prioritize the environmental and social
issues that are of the highest importance to our
stakeholders and where we believe our business
has the greatest impact. Working across the
business, our Global Sustainability & Social
Impact team and broader Global Impact function
continuously gather insights to determine
where to focus our efforts, evolve our strategy
and enhance our reporting. This includes
engaging regularly with both internal and external
stakeholders to discuss the nuances of key issues
and transparency expectations.
Engaging NGOs and academic advisors
through strategic partnerships is a key part of
how we have determined environmental and
social priorities over the last few decades. We
engage with a wide range of NGOs, associations
and external experts who provide insights
and perspectives that shape our strategies,
research, goals, policies and performance
indicators. We also monitor emerging laws
and regulations concerning environmental
and social impact topics and reporting while
engaging with policymakers to inform them of
our environmental, social and governance (ESG)
commitments and progress.
In addition, our enterprise-wide risk management
is designed to identify, assess and prioritize
strategic, financial and reputational risks that
could have a sustained impact on our Company.
The ERM framework leverages internal risk
committees with cross-functional leadership,
including sustainability and social impact leaders
and team members. These committees meet
regularly to evaluate and prioritize risks in the
context of our business strategy, with further
escalation to our CEO, Board and/or Board
Committees, as appropriate.
Our Impact Strategy
Our Planet
We’re helping to drive climate action,
protecting natural resources, reducing
waste and transitioning to more
sustainable packaging and toys.
Food Quality & Sourcing
We’re working toward responsibly
sourcing our priority commodities,
prioritizing animal health and welfare
and making safe, quality food accessible
to families across the world.
Jobs, Inclusion
& Empowerment
We’re serving up bright futures in our
communities, nurturing skills, helping
to accelerate equity and respecting
human rights.
Community Connection
We’re helping feed and support people
when and where they need it most.

Introduction Our Planet Food Quality & Sourcing Jobs, Inclusion & Empowerment Community Connection Appendix
Our Governance Approach
We believe a robust governance structure is critical to effectively managing our strategies, goals
and performance indicators tied to environmental and social issues. We have defined owners and
certifying officers for each of our public commitments and disclosures. Supported by cross-functional
working groups, Franchisees and suppliers, these individuals are accountable for progress, elevation
of key risks, accuracy and completeness of disclosure. Our Impact Reporting & ESG Governance team
supports commitment and disclosure owners in providing relevant updates to the following governance
oversight bodies.
Governance Body Oversight Responsibility Engagement Frequency
Board of Directors Oversees our business in an honest, fair,
diligent and ethical manner; reviews our
strategic direction and objectives; and is
responsible for overseeing our ERM framework.
Regular engagement, including by its
Corporate Responsibility Committee
(previously named Sustainability & Corporate
Responsibility), which met four times in 2023.
Senior Leadership team Accountable for leading our Impact Strategy,
including management of ESG-related
risks and opportunities to help create long-
term value.
Ongoing engagement.
ESG Disclosure Committee Oversees procedures related to the
governance of our ESG disclosures, including
external impact reporting.
Met six times in 2023, with ongoing informal
engagement between meetings.
Global Sustainability &
Social Impact team
Provides Corporate Staff leadership,
coordination and support for our global
sustainability policies, programs and reporting.
Ongoing engagement.

Our Reporting
In This Report
Our progress and actions are covered in this
report, which provides a review of the strides
and progress we made in 2023. Unless otherwise
stated, the information and data in this report
covers McDonald’s Corporation and its majority-
owned subsidiaries worldwide during fiscal year
2023 (January 1 to December 31).
The inclusion of information in this Purpose &
Impact Report is not an indication that such
information is material in the context of our
financial statements, filings with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)
or other public statements. The data contained
in this report has not been audited or verified
by any third party. While such data represents
the best information available at the time of
publishing this report, it is subject to certain
limitations related to, among other things, the
data collection processes in place at the time
such data was collected. For certain figures
throughout this report, the Company changed
its rounding presentation compared to previous
reports to the nearest tenths decimal, rather
than the nearest hundredths decimal. In certain
circumstances, this change adjusted previously
reported figures; however, these changes were
not significant. Additionally, certain columns and
rows within the statements and tables presented
in this report may not add due to rounding.
In addition, certain information in this report
has been provided by third parties, including
our suppliers. In these cases, we have relied
on these third parties for accuracy and
completeness. Statements about future
developments and past occurrences are based
on information and assumptions available as of
the date of publication.
Our Franchisees and suppliers are independent
business owners who make decisions for
their own organizations while maintaining
core standards for our brand and customer
satisfaction. We cannot prescribe solutions for
them. Rather, we work in collaboration to raise
awareness and provide tools and opportunities
to help them manage ESG issues. We work with
suppliers to mutually set objectives and targets,
monitor progress and engage collaboratively on
shared innovation opportunities and challenges.
Through self-managed excellence, suppliers
are encouraged to identify and manage key
ESG risks and opportunities within their own
companies and incorporate relevant goals into
their business strategies.
Company employees and Company-owned
and operated restaurants are in our direct
sphere of control. Therefore, many of the
measures start with Company restaurants,
with a plan to demonstrate success and
encourage Franchisees to implement the
same sustainability initiatives.

2024 Broiler Welfare Goal (Multiple Markets): We are committed
to sourcing chickens raised with improved welfare outcomes.
To achieve this, we have outlined eight specific commitments
for our in-scope markets, which are expected to be fully
implemented by the end of 2024.1
We are on track to achieve our 2024 Broiler Welfare Commitments across in-scope markets.
As of the end of 2023, in-scope markets represented more than 58% of our global chicken supply.
These commitments apply to chicken raised for sale at McDonald’s restaurants in Australia, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, the U.K. and the U.S.
2025 Cage-Free Eggs Goal (U.S.): The U.S. has a goal of sourcing
100% cage-free eggs.
As of the end of 2023, McDonald’s USA has achieved its commitment of sourcing 100% cage-free eggs for
items served on its breakfast menus by 2025 – two years ahead of schedule.
2027 Responsible Antibiotic Use in Chicken Supply Chain Goal
(Multiple Markets): Eliminate the use of antibiotics defined
by the World Health Organization (WHO) as Highest Priority
Critically Important Antibiotics (HPCIAs) to human medicine
from all chicken served in in-scope markets.2
Across the in-scope markets, HPCIA use has been eliminated in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Japan,
South Korea and the U.S., with China expected to comply before the end of 2027.
2024 Pork Housing Goal (U.S.): We’re working with pork suppliers
to phase out the use of gestation stalls (small, enclosed pens)
for housing pregnant sows.
As of the end of 2023, more than 96% of our pork purchased in the U.S. comes from suppliers that have
phased out the use of gestation stalls for housing confirmed pregnant sows.
This marks continued significant progress on our journey to maximize the time pregnant sows spend in
a group environment. Our commitment is guided by the industry- and American Association of Swine
Veterinarians (AASV)-endorsed definition for group housing for pregnant sows. In 2023, McDonald’s bought
more than 230 million pounds of pork from producers that house pregnant sows in groups.
All target years are as of year-end, unless otherwise stated.

2030 By the end of 2030, from a 2018 base year, McDonald’s
commits to:
– Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50.4%
from Company-owned and operated restaurants
and offices.
In 2023, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) validated our global 2050 net zero emissions reduction
target and our adjusted 2030 global emissions target, aligned with the latest guidance to help keep global
temperature rises below 1.5°C.3
Guided by our climate risk and opportunities insights and driven by our goals, during 2023, we pursued various
actions to help reduce emissions and move our net zero strategy forward – from enhancing how we design
and power restaurants to encouraging more sustainable farming techniques.
– Reduce absolute Scope 3 energy and industrial GHG
emissions by 50.4% from Franchisee and Company-owned
and operated restaurants, and the facility, logistics and
plastic packaging emissions in our supply chain.
– Reduce absolute Scope 3 Forest, Land and Agriculture
(FLAG) GHG emissions by 16% and to maintain no
deforestation across its primary deforestation-linked
commodities.

2030 Eliminate Deforestation Goal (Multiple Markets): Eliminate
deforestation from our global supply chains, building on
the progress from our 2020 milestones in highest priority
commodities and regions.
We continue our focus on supporting deforestation-free supply chains for our primary commodities: beef, soy
(for chicken feed), palm oil, coffee and fiber (used in primary guest packaging).
In aggregate, 99.1% of these primary commodities continued to be sourced supporting deforestation-free
supply chains in 2023.4

2025 Women in Leadership Goal (Multiple Markets): McDonald’s
aspires to increase representation of women in leadership
roles globally (Senior Director and above) to 45%, with an
overall goal to reach gender parity globally in leadership roles
(Senior Director and above) by the end of 2030.
As of the end of 2023, 44% of leadership roles (Senior Director and above) globally are held by women.5
2025 Historically Underrepresented Groups in Leadership
Goal (U.S.): McDonald’s aspires to increase representation of
Underrepresented Groups in leadership roles (Senior Director
and above) located in the U.S. to 35%.6
As of the end of 2023, 33% of leadership roles (Senior Director and above) located in the U.S. are held by
individuals in Underrepresented Groups.6,7
Annual Equal Pay Goal (Multiple Markets): McDonald’s commits
to close pay gaps identified in annual equal pay analyses for
women globally in Company-owned and operated markets
and for Underrepresented Groups6 in the U.S. at Staff and
Company-owned and operated restaurant levels.
Results of the 2023 pay gap analysis demonstrated continuous annual progress: women globally in Company-
owned and operated markets were paid, on average, 99.96 cents on the dollar in base pay of what men were
paid for similar work. Further, there was no base pay gap disfavoring Underrepresented Groups in the U.S.
These results indicate the Company substantially attained equal pay, and in 2024, intends to close the small
gaps identified in line with our commitment. 6,8
All target years are as of year-end, unless otherwise stated.

By the end of 2023, we were 86.7% of the way toward our goal. Approximately 97.9% of our primary fiber-based
guest packaging globally was sourced from recycled or certified sources in 2023. Non-structural components
of packaging12 are out of scope.
2025 Added Fluorinated Compounds Goal (Multiple Markets):
Ensure all primary guest packaging is free from intentionally
added fluorinated compounds.13
By the end of 2023, 99.5% of our guest packaging items did not contain intentionally added fluorinated
compounds. For the remaining items, we continue to find and apply alternative coating materials that offer
the right grease-resistant barriers. In the U.S., we have removed all intentionally added fluorinated compounds
from our guest packaging.
McDonald’s guest packaging materials comply with applicable law and are verified through
chemical testing.
2025 Guest Recycling Goal (Multiple Markets): We aim to
implement global and local solutions across our business to
advance the reduction, reuse, composting and/or recycling
of guest packaging, and help create demand for recycled
materials.
In 2023, approximately 88.3% of restaurants in markets with advanced infrastructure14 offered guests the
opportunity to recycle and/or compost packaging items. In these restaurants, guest packaging is collected in
customer-facing bins for back-of-house or off-site sorting for recycling or composting, utilizing existing local
waste infrastructure systems.
2025 Plastic Reduction in Happy Meal Toys Goal (Multiple
Markets): Drastically reduce plastics in Happy Meal toys
around the globe and transition to more sustainable
materials.15
As of the end of 2023, we reduced virgin fossil fuel-based plastic in Happy Meal toys by 63.7%,
an improvement from the 47.8% reduction achieved in 2022.
Achieving this goal is expected to result in continuous reduction in virgin fossil fuel-based plastic
used to make Happy Meal toys. We have been increasing the use of more sustainable plastics, decreasing our
dependence on virgin resources.

11 Packaging. Scope: Inclusive of all markets for our fiber-based packaging and
Happy Meal book and toy packaging. For our plastic-based packaging, all
markets are included except for Israel, Latin America and Turkey. Renewable
sources refers to material that is composed of biomass from a living source
and that can be continually replenished. Renewable applies to plastics only, not
fiber. Source: ISO 14021:2016 for plastic, ASTM 6866 or ISO 16620-2. Fiber-based
packaging made from 100% recycled sources must be third-party verified,
unless certified under a Chain of Custody Forest Management standard.
McDonald’s requires all wood fiber sourced from Argentina, Cambodia, China,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Russia and Vietnam to be Forest Stewardship
Council® (FSC®) certified or FSC® controlled wood sources with full chain of
custody certification. Perfluorinated compounds are known to be historically
persistent in the environment. McDonald’s commits to not intentionally adding
fluorinated compounds through our processes, but fluorinated compounds
present in the local environment make it difficult to remove all traces of
fluorine from packaging. Please refer to our Nature, Forests & Water web page
for additional definitions. Exclusions: Primary fiber-based packaging in food
packaged off-site of McDonald’s restaurants, tray liners and limited locally
sourced items.
12 Non-structural components of packaging vary based on the packaging but
may include adhesives, inks, overprint varnishes, retention agents or binders,
processing aids, impact modifiers, minerals used non-structurally and
nucleating and clarifying agents. We continue to monitor industry standards
on these components and opportunities to work toward making any part of our
packaging, including non-structural components, more sustainable.

14 Markets with advanced infrastructure: Mature waste and recycling
infrastructure at a national level that has (1) recycling infrastructure network
across the entire market, (2) multiple materials being recycled within this
national infrastructure network, (3) existing legislation on recycling and (4) high
customer awareness of waste and recycling. At the end of 2023, that included
21 markets where McDonald’s operates.
15 Toys. Scope: Inclusive of all toys. Fiber-based toys or fiber components in the
toys: 100% certified fiber required. All other materials: McDonald’s ambition
is to reduce the use of virgin fossil fuel-based plastics, offer more sustainable
toys by the end of 2025 and not manufacture electronics and batteries in
Happy Meal toys globally. For bio- and plant-based plastics to be considered
sustainable for McDonald’s, a minimum of 60% of plastic weight is required to
come from recycled or renewable content or a combination of recycled and
renewable content, though in many practical applications we anticipate that
percentage will be much higher. The remaining 40% may be conventional
fossil fuel-based material. These thresholds were developed in conjunction
with input from NGOs, external manufacturing partners and scientists, and
based on an assessment of sustainable toy and packaging industry leaders
so that our targets reflected current sustainable engineering capabilities to
maintain safety and functionality. Our efforts will result in an approximate
90% reduction in virgin fossil fuel-based plastic use against a 2018 baseline.
Fiber-based packaging made from 100% recycled sources must be third-

Introduction Our Planet Food Quality & Sourcing Jobs, Inclusion & Empowerment Community Connection Appendix
Our Strategy in Brief
Climate change is one of the biggest
challenges of our time. Natural disasters and
extreme weather patterns pose increased risks
to food supply resilience and communities
around the world, including those from which
we operate and source.
We have a unique opportunity as a global brand
to mobilize the entire McDonald’s System – the
Company, Franchisees and direct and indirect
suppliers – to catalyze change. Working with
the McDonald’s System, we are helping reduce
the climate impact of our restaurants and
food systems.
We aim to embed our climate goals across our
operations and are prioritizing actions in the
most carbon-intensive aspects of Company-
and Franchisee-owned and operated
restaurants and our supply chain.
We continue to implement our strategy
through various actions, including:
• Restaurants and offices: We are driving a
transition to more renewable energy while
identifying opportunities to enhance energy
efficiency by design in our restaurants and
the equipment we use, such as by identifying
lower-impact refrigerant solutions. We are
accelerating circularity to help reduce the
impact of our guest packaging and waste,
and designing décor for greater circularity
in our restaurants. These efforts are also
supported by strategic supply chain actions
in support of climate action.
• Supply chain: We are engaging suppliers
to set targets that support emissions
reductions within their operations and
supply chains, and that align with our
own Scope 3 SBTi goal. Together with our
suppliers and other relevant stakeholders,
we are accelerating and scaling farm
projects to help reduce emissions, with
a focus on regenerative agriculture, farm
management and deforestation elimination
consistent with our Commitment on Forests
and Natural Ecosystems. We also encourage
our suppliers to reduce their facilities’
emissions and source renewable energy.
• Collaborating to drive and advocate for
change: Beyond our System, we are using
our business’ scale to work with industry,
governments, NGOs and others to advocate
for climate action initiatives.

strategy and our approach to responsible
sourcing on our website. Additionally,
see our 2023 Climate Resiliency Summary
for more comprehensive disclosure on our
climate approach and progress.
Climate Resiliency
When it comes to climate action, we take a
targeted approach, using risk management
processes to identify, prioritize and address
climate-related risks and opportunities that
could directly or indirectly impact our business.
We have set out the key levers we will need to
use to achieve our latest climate ambitions.
We articulate some of our climate risks,
opportunities and levers in our 2023 Climate
Resiliency Summary.

Introduction Our Planet Food Quality & Sourcing Jobs, Inclusion & Empowerment Community Connection Appendix
Our Net Zero Targets
In 2018, we set targets, approved by the SBTi,
to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in
line with a 2˚C warming scenario. Since then,
as science has evolved, so have our targets. In
2023, the SBTi validated our global 2050 net zero
emissions reduction target and our adjusted
2030 global emissions target, aligned with the
latest guidance to help keep global temperature
rises below 1.5°C.2
Our 2030 Emissions Target
By the end of 2030, from a 2018 base year,
McDonald’s commits to reduce:
• Absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by
50.4% from Company-owned and operated
restaurants and offices.
• Absolute Scope 3 energy and industrial GHG
emissions by 50.4% from Franchisee and
Company-owned and operated restaurants,
and the facility, logistics and plastic packaging
emissions in our supply chain.
• Absolute Scope 3 Forest, Land and Agriculture
(FLAG) GHG emissions by 16% and to
maintain no deforestation across its primary
deforestation-linked commodities.
Achieving these ambitions will require continued
and immediate action throughout our own
business and across our full value chain –
including our Franchisees and suppliers, with
support and enabling conditions and policies
from industry peers, NGOs and government
on all levels. Among other efforts, we intend to
continue focusing on:
• Adding renewable energy to the grid,
including through Virtual Power Purchase
Agreements (VPPAs).
• Scaling regenerative agriculture practices
within our supply chain.
• Contributing to deforestation-free supply
chains for our primary commodities through
our sourcing actions.
• Using our voice to advocate for climate-
positive policies globally.
Our Performance
The figures below reflect our 2023 GHG
emissions relative to our 2018 base year.
GHG Emissions (Metric Tons CO2e)1
Emissions 2018 (Baseline) 2023
Scope 1 emissions 106,963 100,264
Scope 2 emissions

Scope 3 emissions 62,354,135* 59,929,320
* These 2018 baseline Scope 3 emissions were updated in 2024 to reflect more
complete product volume inputs and the inclusion of Category 7 Employee
Commuting emissions, which were first included for baseline and current
reporting in 2023.
Guided by our climate risk and opportunities
insights and driven by our goals, during 2023,
we pursued various actions to help reduce
emissions and move our net zero strategy
forward – from enhancing how we design
and power restaurants to encouraging more
sustainable farming techniques. We also
continued to make progress in other areas that
can support our climate goals, for example,
supporting deforestation-free supply chains and
finding more ways to reduce the impact of our
guest packaging.
More Sustainable Restaurant
Development
With two of our climate targets focused on
reducing restaurant-related emissions, how
we operate and design our restaurants
represents a key opportunity for progressing
toward net zero by 2050. We are evaluating
ways to update existing restaurants for lower
environmental impact while embedding
sustainability considerations further into
our new-build processes.
Examples of Our Efforts Across the Globe
Our markets are leading on innovation to
reduce emissions and enhance the customer
experience related to their restaurants.
For example, as of 2023:
• In Sweden, 55 charging stations are offered
in McDonald’s restaurants across the country.
To help people refuel themselves and their
electric vehicles (EV), restaurant signposts
were updated, creating versions of classic gas
station signs that also feature the price of our
Big Mac® sandwich and Happy Meal®.
• In São Paolo, Brazil, a 24-hour restaurant is
being built from wood and recycled materials
using innovative, low-energy construction
methods. The completed space will feature
recycled material walls and floors, compost
bins and a living roof to help naturally regulate
temperature and humidity. Thermal insulation,
efficient equipment and solar-powered,
automated LED lighting will reduce energy
use, while an EV charging point and parking for
bikes and e-bikes will promote more lower-
emission customer transportation.

CASE STUDY
A More Circular Approach
to Restaurant Design
We are continuously evolving the customer
and crew experience, including the way we
build and furnish our spaces. In December
2023, we debuted circular restaurant décor
in two French restaurants, testing innovative
solutions that balance visual impact
with sustainability.
The restaurants – in Carbonne and La
Guerche de Bretagne – feature décor
and furniture that have been specifically
designed for easy disassembly. Held
together with mechanical features rather
than glue, pieces can be broken down
by raw material type at their end of use,
enabling easier recycling or reuse. The pilot
restaurants also feature 80% Programme
for the Endorsement of Forest Certification
(PEFC) wood, energy-efficient lighting and
100% recycled content for plastic used in
tabletops and low stools (at least 80% for
chairs). We have removed laminates and
powder coatings from furniture and décor
elements to facilitate greater recycling, as
well as reuse of steel components. And,
because we believe in finding ways to
give used materials a second life, window
shutters and suspensions have been made
from repurposed cardboard, while coffee
bean waste has been incorporated into
McCafé® tabletops.
To hold ourselves accountable for progress,
we engaged sustainability consultancy
Anthesis to help create a measurement
index that tracks the circularity of our global
restaurant décor. As a result of the features
we trialed in France, we improved our score
from 14% to 53%. It’s progress we’re proud
of, but we’re not stopping there – our new
2024 pilots will see us also introduce more
sustainable foams and upholstery.
Renewable Energy Procurement
Investing in renewable energy and energy
efficiency is a key lever of our climate strategy.
We enter into VPPAs, where appropriate, to help
contribute to adding more renewable energy to
the grid.
Since 2019, McDonald’s has signed multiple
large-scale renewable energy VPPAs that will
help add new renewable energy to the U.S. grid.
The projects we have contracted add renewable
energy through solar and wind technologies
and are operational in Texas, Illinois, Oklahoma
and Louisiana. We have invested in additional
projects that we expect to become operational
in the coming years.
Supply Chain Engagement
Addressing Scope 3 emissions – our largest
source of emissions – requires buy-in from our
supply chain. We require our global beef and
chicken suppliers to commit to setting science-
based targets validated by the SBTi. We are
currently supporting dairy and cheese suppliers
to do the same, or to set equally ambitious third-
party-certified targets. Additionally, as of 2023,
our independent logistics suppliers have set
SBTi-approved science-based targets.
McDonald’s Corporation Purpose & Impact Report 2023–2024 20
Introduction Our Planet Food Quality & Sourcing Jobs, Inclusion & Empowerment Community Connection Appendix
We also continue to identify opportunities to
participate in external groups that aim to shape
the future of climate action and accounting for
our industry and supply chain. This includes the
Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Technical Working
Group on Land Based Emissions, which we
joined to help establish standards and guidance
for measuring the impact of emissions from
farming, forestry and other land-based activities.
For more information on how we engage in
industrywide collaborations and advocate
for solutions that will enable progress on our
climate strategy for our full System, please
see our Climate Action web page.
As well as encouraging target setting, we’re
working with suppliers and farmers across
the world to help them scale regenerative
agriculture practices and eliminate deforestation
consistent with our Commitment on Forests
and Natural Ecosystems, in ways that can
help improve productivity, build resiliency
to a changing climate and conserve
natural ecosystems.
Read more about our approach to
regenerative agriculture on page 37
and on our Responsible Sourcing web page.
Next Steps
We will continue to progress toward net zero
emissions globally by 2050. This includes
working to establish roadmaps for key markets
and business functions. At the same time, we
will look for more opportunities to act globally
and regionally, using the scale of our System to
drive positive change.

Introduction Our Planet Food Quality & Sourcing Jobs, Inclusion & Empowerment Community Connection Appendix
Our Strategy in Brief
We’re committed to taking steps to help
reduce waste and advance a circular
economy. For example, we’re investing
in strategies and working collaboratively
with other stakeholders to help address
systemic challenges related to recycling
infrastructure, demand for recycled materials
and development of new packaging and
toy materials. We continue to evaluate and
consider the role reusables can play in our
restaurants around the world, alongside other
circularity solutions and in compliance with
applicable laws regarding reusable packaging.
Our Performance
As a global brand with representation in over 100
countries, there is no “one size fits all” approach
to packaging and recycling solutions, as local
waste management infrastructure and customer
preferences make each area unique. That’s why
we pursue opportunities on a localized basis
to help identify appropriate solutions for each
geography – all grounded in a commitment to
advancing the Company’s global goals.
We set our circularity strategy, inclusive of a
series of goals unique to our business model,
to guide our efforts, with expert advice from
several stakeholders, such as World Wildlife
Fund (WWF) and our packaging supplier tms, to
help ensure our targets aligned with the latest
science and stakeholder expectations. We track
progress against our goals through supplier and
restaurant reports on packaging composition,
usage and waste. As we continue to enhance our
methodology and data quality, we can expect
annual progress figures to adjust in future
reporting cycles.
As well as tracking against our goals, throughout
2023, we continued finding ways to streamline
materials used in overall guest packaging and
to reduce use where possible. For example, our
Nordic markets (including Denmark, Finland,
Norway and Sweden) adopted a “no lids on cold
drink cups” policy for dine-in customers.

Packaging Innovation Efforts
To identify opportunities for transitioning our
existing materials to new and more sustainable
alternatives in pursuit of progress toward our
2025 goals, many of our markets and suppliers
have worked to drive locally relevant packaging
innovations across the globe.
Following a successful pilot, in 2023, we
launched clear polypropylene beverage cups
across the U.S. that contribute to the sourcing
of circular and bio-based materials.6 Our
goal is that these cups can be recycled into
new products, contributing to a circular
economy.
7, 8 We plan to continue rolling out
additional items, such as lids, sundae cups,
breakfast platters and souffle cups over the
next few years.
When it comes to developing alternatives for
packaging liners, we are investing in technology
and supply chain capabilities and collaborating
with our suppliers to do so. To replace virgin
fossil fuel-based plastics, we are gaining insight
into front-running technologies, such as mineral
coatings for cups, and the potential for such
technologies to be applied at scale.
We continue to develop and deploy renewable
coating alternatives on fiber-based salad boxes
in Europe. In 2023, Austria, the Baltics and the
Netherlands transitioned to this solution from
the previously used polyethylene (PE)-coated
salad boxes.

Introduction Our Planet Food Quality & Sourcing Jobs, Inclusion & Empowerment Community Connection Appendix
We continue to focus on reducing virgin fossil
fuel-based plastics for small items such as
straws, cutlery, bags and stirrers.
Happy Meal Toy Innovation
In 2023, we introduced an increased range of
materials that support our goal around Happy
Meal toys, including bio-based plastics produced
from renewable sources as well as paper.
Programs that used paper were developed, such
as Karma’s World activity journals and Pokémon
trading cards. Green PE (bio-based PE produced
from renewable raw material sugar cane) was
successfully used in programs like Adopt Me!
“Make a Pet,” which was a customizable pet made
from a combination of Green PE and paper.
To continue driving innovation toward our 2025
ambition of reducing virgin plastics in Happy
Meal toys, we have begun working with our
supplier tms to utilize its recently established
“Future Lab” – a facility dedicated to testing
innovative packaging solutions. Future Lab was
established with a dual focused approach:
• Materials lab: Identify new sustainable
materials, suppliers and production
techniques, as well as vendor capabilities.
Qualify new materials and research
production functionality.
• Concept research: Ideate new concepts that
are fun, durable and deliver high perceived
value with approved materials. Create new play
experiences that support sustainability.
Reducing Plastics in
Happy Meal Toys
GOAL
Drastically reduce plastics in
Happy Meal toys around the globe
and transition to more sustainable
materials by the end of 2025.9
PROGRESS
As of the end of 2023, we reduced
virgin fossil fuel-based plastic
in Happy Meal toys by 63.7%, an
improvement from the 47.8%
reduction achieved in 2022.
Achieving this goal is expected to result in
continuous reduction in virgin fossil fuel-based
plastic used to make Happy Meal toys. We have
been increasing the use of more sustainable
plastics, decreasing our dependence on
virgin resources.
CASE STUDY
Fiber-Based Packaging
As we strive to meet our goal, we are working
with suppliers to test new technologies that
can scale globally. Some of our markets are
exploring transitioning from plastic to fiber-
based packaging. For example, beginning
in 2023:
• We have launched small-scale testing of
fiber-based packaging in Belgium, Ireland
and Portugal with initial insights being
gathered through these pilots.
• In the EU, we are working to incorporate
recycled materials into fiber-based
packaging categories such as carryout
bags, cups, carriers, napkins, cartons, hot
cups and sleeves.
• Fiber, wooden and pressed paper cutlery
are now deployed across 50 markets,
including parts of the EU and the U.K.
Canada and Hong Kong are also using
fiber-based cutlery.
• Wooden stirrers have been deployed in
most markets globally.
• In Japan, we have transitioned to a fiber-
based solution for salad boxes.
• In Western Australia, we regionally
launched molded fiber cold lids.
• We are using paper straws in markets such
as Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan,
New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore
and South Korea.
• The Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland and
Norway have transitioned to paper cups
from plastic.

Advance the Reduction, Reuse or
Recycling of Guest Packaging
GOAL
We aim to implement global and
local solutions across our business
to advance the reduction, reuse,
composting and/or recycling of
guest packaging, and help create
demand for recycled materials by the
end of 2025.
PROGRESS
In 2023, approximately 88.3%
of restaurants in markets with
advanced infrastructure4 offered
guests the opportunity to recycle
and/or compost packaging items. In
these restaurants, guest packaging is
collected in customer-facing bins
for back-of-house or off-site
sorting for recycling or composting,
utilizing existing local waste
infrastructure systems.
Across the globe, waste and recycling
infrastructure differs significantly. Some
areas are operating within advanced
infrastructure, while in others the infrastructure
is still developing. In areas where recycling
infrastructure is a challenge, we’re focusing on
addressing systemic constraints and advocating
for greater investment in material separation,
sorting, recovery and recycler acceptance.
Exploring the Role of Reusable Packaging
In recent years, we have been exploring the
potential role and impact of implementing
reusable guest packaging in McDonald’s
restaurants. Although reusable guest packaging
may be part of the solution, additional tools,
such as recycling, recovery and reduction, must
continue to be part of overall guest packaging-
related waste reduction strategies. Only with
the right mix of solutions, can McDonald’s – and
the informal eating out sector more broadly –
achieve packaging circularity.
As we move forward, we will look to further
develop our reuse strategy, advocating for
feasible solutions that can help advance
evidence-based circularity strategies for
McDonald’s and the wider industry.
Fluorinated Compounds
in Our Packaging
GOAL
Ensure all primary guest packaging
is free from intentionally added
fluorinated compounds by the end
of 2025.10
PROGRESS
By the end of 2023, 99.5% of
our guest packaging items did
not contain intentionally added
fluorinated compounds. For the
remaining items, we continue to
find and apply alternative coating
materials that offer the right grease-
resistant barriers. In the U.S., we
have removed all intentionally added
fluorinated compounds from our
guest packaging.
McDonald’s guest packaging materials comply
with applicable law and are verified through
chemical testing.
Next Steps
McDonald’s will continue finding ways
to innovate our packaging, as well as
opportunities for end-of-life management, to
help keep waste out of nature. The Company
will continue our ambition to use renewable,
recycled and certified materials solutions for
our guest packaging portfolio and other areas
to encourage a circular economy.

Our Strategy in Brief
We aim to safeguard natural ecosystems,
including forests, throughout our supply chains
while simultaneously building resilience for our
business, producers and the planet. We’re also
taking action to help protect biodiversity and
respect human rights. We stress the importance
of water stewardship to suppliers and in our
restaurant practices.
To adapt our value chain to – and mitigate
against – climate change, we prepare for
climatic events that could impact the natural
resources we depend on, as well as transition
risks associated with the shift to a low-carbon
economy. Our targets for climate action
consider estimated emissions from land use
change – such as deforestation for farmland –
which are modeled using our climate impact
tracking system.
We also encourage others to do their part and
help drive industry action at scale through our
memberships in collaborative groups like the
Forest Positive Coalition, as well as our work
in international bodies such as the Global
Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB) and
the Sustainable Markets Initiative.

Our Performance and Actions
Our Commitment to Supporting
Deforestation-Free Supply
Chains for Primary Commodities
In 2024, we refreshed our Commitment on
Forests and Natural Ecosystems to better reflect
the evolution of industry best practices and
standards and our progress to safeguard natural
ecosystems. In it, we outline our commitment
to eliminate deforestation16 and address
conversion17 in our global supply chain by 2030,
for commodities and regions where we can
deliver the greatest impact – building on our
2020 milestones to support deforestation-free
supply chains for our primary commodities.
In line with our commitment, we are collaborating
with Proforest, WWF and industry groups on
actions to help build positive impact. We are
also engaging with suppliers to help ensure they
understand the commitment and their role in
adhering to the sustainable sourcing policies
that underscore it.
GOAL
Eliminate deforestation from our
global supply chains by the end
of 2030, building on the progress
from our 2020 milestones in highest
priority commodities and regions.
We continue our focus on supporting
deforestation-free supply chains for our
primary commodities: beef, soy (for chicken
feed), palm oil, coffee and fiber (used in primary
guest packaging).
PROGRESS
In aggregate, 99.1% of these primary
commodities continued to be sourced
supporting deforestation-free supply
chains in 2023.18
See our commodity-specific progress on
page 25.
Soy (for Chicken Feed)
As one example of our work to source
sustainable soy for chicken feed, the McDonald’s
UK & Ireland markets map and report on their
embedded soy footprint annually as part of our
work to address conversion. They then utilize
this information to support tailored supplier
engagement. Additionally, McDonald’s UK &
Ireland is among the founding signatories of the
UK Soy Manifesto to work collaboratively across
the industry to support resilient and responsible
supply chains.
Palm Oil
Our volumes of physical RSPO-certified palm
oil increased from 13% in 2016 to 72.5% in 2023
(25% Segregated, 47.5% Mass Balance), with the
remaining 27.5% as RSPO Book and Claim Credits.
Forest Positive Coalition
In 2022, we joined the Consumer Goods Forum’s
Forest Positive Coalition, a multi-company
initiative to stop commodity-driven deforestation
and address global climate change issues across
consumer goods manufacturers and retailers.
As part of our ongoing membership, for the
second year in a row, we developed a report to
highlight our progress against the coalition’s
key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics.
Additionally, in 2023, we became co-leads of the
coalition’s Beef Working Group.

CASE STUDY
Driving a Deforestation-Free
Beef Supply Chain
When it comes to deforestation-free
beef supply chains, we are partnering
strategically to advance supplier efforts. In
particular, we have teamed up with service
provider Agrotools to identify key, farm-
level social and environmental criteria in our
beef supply chain, and to monitor supplier
compliance with our expectations.
We are focused on purchasing beef from
suppliers that share our dedication to
conserving forests and respecting human
rights. To ensure ongoing alignment,
together with Agrotools, we conduct
comprehensive monitoring of our Brazilian
supply chain to proactively detect and
address instances of:
• Deforestation.
• Properties associated with forced labor
or embargoes.
• Agricultural expansion onto Indigenous
Territories or protected areas.
Through detailed mapping exercises,
we also monitor compliance with our
Deforestation-Free Beef Procurement Policy
for purchases of cattle that could potentially
enter our supply chain from Brazil, Argentina,
Paraguay or Australia. With this insight,
we are better equipped to support shared
deforestation efforts, delivering supplier
training and pursuing other engagement
activities to drive greater human and
community rights protection and more
responsible, data-driven procurement
decisions. We are proud that, as a result of
our detailed monitoring and close supplier
engagement efforts, in 2023, 98.8% of
all beef sourced for McDonald’s products
supported deforestation-free supply chains.
Our Progress on Protecting
Nature, Forests and Water
Sustainable Palm Oil
The Company is committed to working with
stakeholders and its supply chain to help
support development and improvement of
sustainable palm oil production, and to help
drive delivery of NDPE (no deforestation, no
expansion on peat and no exploitation).
Alongside Proforest, we recently engaged
with one of our major palm oil suppliers,
Wilmar, on a series of projects to help
improve transparency and sustainability
outcomes for our palm oil supply chain.
Through this collaboration, we have been
engaged in the development of the NDPE
Implementation Reporting Framework
(IRF), building on progress made to date to
provide an overview of progress for all palm
oil mills supporting a refinery. Our work
will drive greater improvement in NDPE IRF
Deforestation and Peat profiles as well as
Land and Labor profiles within our supply
chains, including greater engagement with
smallholders to help improve traceability and
sustainability outcomes.
Evaluating Land Use Change
In the U.S., McDonald’s joined the Land Use
Change Initiative (LUCI) to begin to address land
use change in our supply chains. This coalition
is a cross-sector collaboration to evaluate the
condition of remaining U.S. native sod19 and
evaluate the drivers and impacts of land use
change. We will use the outputs of the LUCI to
inform our strategy to further address land use
change in the United States.
For more on our approach and progress
toward regenerative agriculture, see page 37
and our Responsible Sourcing web page.
Next Steps
We will continue to take steps to help bring
the McDonald’s Commitment on Forests and
Natural Ecosystems to life. We aim to strengthen
our resiliency by building on our work to date
and engaging in new initiatives to help drive
collective action toward the protection of
forests, human rights and natural ecosystems.
McDonald’s Corporation Purpose & Impact Report 2023–2024 27
Introduction Our Planet Food Quality & Sourcing Jobs, Inclusion & Empowerment Community Connection Appendix
Notes
1 Consistent with past reporting by the Company, these figures include
the impact through 2023 of the Corporate-backed VPPA program in the
U.S., recognizing that the SBTi is currently assessing the effectiveness of
Environmental Attribute Certificates (EACs) in corporate climate targets to
inform its revisions to the net zero standard.
2 McDonald’s SBTi-validated target in full:
• McDonald’s Corporation commits to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG
emissions 50.4% by 2030 from a 2018 base year.
• McDonald’s Corporation also commits to reduce absolute Scope 3 energy
and industrial GHG emissions from purchased goods and services, fuel
and energy-related activities, upstream transportation and distribution,
waste generated in operations, end-of-life treatment of sold products, and
franchises 50.4% within the same timeframe.
• McDonald’s Corporation commits to reduce absolute Scope 3 FLAG GHG
emissions 16% by 2030 from a 2018 base year. McDonald’s Corporation also
commits to maintain no deforestation across its primary deforestation-
linked commodities.
3 Packaging. Scope: Inclusive of all markets for our fiber-based packaging
and Happy Meal book and toy packaging. For our plastic-based packaging,
all markets are included except for Israel, Latin America and Turkey.
Renewable sources refers to material that is composed of biomass from a
living source and that can be continually replenished. Renewable applies to
plastics only, not fiber. Source: ISO 14021:2016 for plastic, ASTM 6866 or
ISO 16620-2. Fiber-based packaging made from 100% recycled sources
must be third-party verified, unless certified under a Chain of Custody Forest
Management standard. McDonald’s requires all wood fiber sourced from
Argentina, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Russia and Vietnam
to be Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®) certified or FSC® controlled wood
sources with full chain of custody certification. Perfluorinated compounds are
known to be historically persistent in the environment. McDonald’s commits
to not intentionally adding fluorinated compounds through our processes,
but fluorinated compounds present in the local environment make it difficult
to remove all traces of fluorine from packaging. Please refer to our Nature,
Forests & Water web page for additional definitions. Exclusions: Primary fiber-
based packaging in food packaged off-site of McDonald’s restaurants, tray
liners and limited locally sourced items.
4 Markets with advanced infrastructure: Mature waste and recycling
infrastructure at a national level that has (1) a recycling infrastructure network
across the entire market, (2) multiple materials being recycled within this
national infrastructure network, (3) existing legislation on recycling and (4) high
customer awareness of waste and recycling. At the end of 2023, that included
21 markets where McDonald’s operates.
5 Non-structural components of packaging vary based on the packaging but
may include adhesives, inks, overprint varnishes, retention agents or binders,
processing aids, impact modifiers, minerals used non-structurally, and
nucleating and clarifying agents. We continue to monitor industry standards
on these components and opportunities to work toward making any part of our
packaging, including non-structural components, more sustainable.
6 The development of the cups relies on the “mass balance free attribution”
approach, which allows the share of raw materials generated through the
processing of plastic waste and bio-based materials to be accounted for via
Chain of Custody certification through complex manufacturing systems, where
it is processed alongside traditional feedstocks and attributed to plastics.
7 Lids and straws are not recyclable. Other similar material items to be launched
by 2025 include cold lids, breakfast platters, sundae and souffle cups.
8 Facilities that accept these cups for recycling may not be available in all
areas of the U.S., but our aim is to help expand the acceptance of the cups for
recycling so they can contribute to a circular economy.
9 Toys. Scope: Inclusive of all toys. Fiber-based toys or fiber components in the
toys: 100% certified fiber required. All other materials: McDonald’s ambition
is to reduce the use of virgin fossil fuel-based plastics, offer more sustainable
toys by the end of 2025 and not manufacture electronics and batteries in
Happy Meal toys globally. For bio- and plant-based plastics to be considered
sustainable for McDonald’s, a minimum of 60% of plastic weight is required to
come from recycled or renewable content or a combination of recycled and
renewable content, though in many practical applications we anticipate that
percentage will be much higher. The remaining 40% may be conventional
fossil fuel-based material. These thresholds were developed in conjunction
with input from NGOs, external manufacturing partners and scientists, and
based on an assessment of sustainable toy and packaging industry leaders
so that our targets reflected current sustainable engineering capabilities to
maintain safety and functionality. Our efforts will result in an approximate
90% reduction in virgin fossil fuel-based plastic use against a 2018 baseline.
Fiber-based packaging made from 100% recycled sources must be third-
party verified, unless certified under a Chain of Custody Forest Management
standard. Source: ISO 14021:2016. McDonald’s requires all wood fiber sourced
from Argentina, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Russia and
Vietnam to be Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®) certified or FSC® controlled
wood sources with full chain of custody certification. The thresholds described
above do not include the presence of adhesives, glues, inks, paints and
coatings.
10 Fluorinated Compounds. Scope: Inclusive of all markets except for Israel,
Latin America and Turkey, and Happy Meal book and toy packaging. Renewable
sources refers to material that is composed of biomass from a living source
and that can be continually replenished. Renewable applies to plastics only, not
fiber. Source: ISO 14021:2016 for plastic, ASTM 6866 or ISO 16620-2. Fiber-based
packaging made from 100% recycled sources must be third-party verified,
unless certified under a Chain of Custody Forest Management standard.
McDonald’s requires all wood fiber sourced from Argentina, Cambodia, China,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Russia and Vietnam to be Forest Stewardship
Council® (FSC®) certified or FSC® controlled wood sources with full chain of
custody certification. Perfluorinated compounds are known to be historically
persistent in the environment. McDonald’s commits to not intentionally adding
fluorinated compounds through our processes, but fluorinated compounds
present in the local environment make it difficult to remove all traces of
fluorine from packaging. Please refer to our Nature, Forests & Water web page
for additional definitions. Exclusions: Primary fiber-based packaging in food
packaged off-site of McDonald’s restaurants, tray liners and limited locally
sourced items.
11 Beef. Scope: Includes all beef suppliers to the McDonald’s System and their
raw material suppliers globally and all McDonald’s restaurants owned and
operated by the Company and its Franchisees that sell beef. McDonald’s
requires all beef raw material sourced from high-deforestation priority regions
to comply with McDonald’s Deforestation-Free Beef Procurement Policy and
meet the requirements as outlined in McDonald’s Commitment on Forests
and Natural Ecosystems. Countries with regions currently identified as high
priority for beef include Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina and Australia. Exclusions:
Beef used as secondary ingredients in McDonald’s products, for example, as
flavoring in a sauce.
12 Coffee. Scope: Includes all ground and whole bean coffee, including
decaffeinated coffee, used in espresso-based drinks and coffee brewed at
McDonald’s restaurants, and all ground and whole bean coffee in McDonald’s-
branded retail products. Includes all suppliers of coffee to the McDonald’s
System. Market scope includes all McDonald’s restaurants owned and
operated by the Company and its Franchisees that sell coffee, and retail
outlets selling McDonald’s-branded coffee products. Countries with regions
currently identified as high-deforestation priority regions for coffee include
Honduras, Indonesia and Vietnam. McDonald’s requires all coffee sourced from
these regions to be Rainforest Alliance Certified. Exclusions: Coffee extracts
and ingredients used in products such as frappés and coffee in baked goods;
coffee in cold brew drinks if they are brewed off-site; coffee extract in ready-to-
drink retail products; and other locally sourced products containing coffee.
13 Soy (for chicken feed). Scope: Includes all soybean volume used in the feed
of chicken sourced for McDonald’s products by all chicken suppliers to the
McDonald’s System and all McDonald’s restaurants owned and operated by
the Company and its Franchisees that sell chicken. Europe refers to Austria,
Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,
Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia,
Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Moldova, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland,
Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
the U.K. and Ukraine. Countries with regions currently identified as high-
deforestation priority regions for soy include Argentina (Chaco biome),
Brazil (Amazon and Cerrado biomes) and Paraguay (Chaco biome). Given the
complexity of soy supply chains, we consider that, unless demonstrated, all of
McDonald’s sources of soy for chicken feed fall into high-deforestation priority
regions, with the exception of chicken sourced in North America, where soy
used in chicken feed is locally produced and considered low risk. Exclusions:
Soy used as an ingredient in McDonald’s products sold in restaurants, for
example, soy oil.
14 Fiber. Scope: Primary fiber-based packaging refers to products that are used
to package guest food on premises at McDonald’s restaurants. This type of
packaging includes containers, cups, wraps, bags for food, beverages, napkins,
folding cartons, clamshells, food service bags, napkins, salad bowls, Happy
Meal cartons, drink carriers and cup carriers. Includes all suppliers of primary-
based packaging to the McDonald’s System and all McDonald’s restaurants
owned and operated by the Company and its Franchisees. In 2021, the primary
fiber-based packaging scope was expanded to include plastic alternatives
such as wood stirrers and cutlery, and paper straws and lids. This broadened
scope has resulted in a slight decrease in percent compliance. All volumes of
contingency items sourced from suppliers compliant with our standards but
not integrated into our data reporting system were counted as non-compliant.
Countries with regions currently identified as high-deforestation priority
regions for fiber include Argentina, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Russia and Vietnam. McDonald’s requires all wood fiber sourced from these
regions to be Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®) certified or FSC® controlled
wood sources with full chain of custody certification. Exclusions: Primary
fiber-based packaging in food packaged off-site McDonald’s restaurants; tray
liners, straws and limited locally sourced items.
15 Palm oil. Scope: Includes all palm oil (including crude palm oil, palm kernel
oil, derivatives and fractions) sourced for McDonald’s restaurants for use
as restaurant cooking oil and all palm oil sourced by McDonald’s suppliers
and used directly as an ingredient in a McDonald’s product and listed on the
product’s ingredient statement. Includes all suppliers of products containing
palm oil in the McDonald’s System and all McDonald’s restaurants owned and
operated by the Company and its Franchisees that use palm oil. All countries
are currently identified as high-deforestation priority regions for palm oil and
all volumes are required to be covered by Roundtable on Sustainable Palm
Oil (RSPO) certification or credits. All RSPO supply chain models applicable
to RSPO are applicable to McDonald’s ‒ RSPO Identity Preserved (IP), RSPO
Segregated (SG), RSPO Mass Balance (MB) and Book and Claim (BC) ‒ although
McDonald’s is committed to increasing traceability by specifying physical
certification for the palm oil used in the McDonald’s System in the greatest
volumes (IP, SG or MB). Exclusions: Palm oil, palm kernel oil or their derivative
used as secondary ingredients in McDonald’s products. This is when palm oil is
used as an ingredient within an ingredient, for example, an emulsifier.
16 “Eliminate deforestation” refers to McDonald’s global pledge to tackle
deforestation, and all of the social and environmental criteria in our
Commitment on Forests and Natural Ecosystems in our agricultural and
forestry supply chains. In alignment with the definitions of the Accountability
Framework initiative (AFi), we use the term “supporting deforestation-free
supply chains” below to more accurately reflect the actions we are taking to
implement, measure and report progress toward our Commitment on Forests
and Natural Ecosystems.
17 As aligned with Accountability Framework Initiative, conversion refers to:
change of a natural ecosystem to another land use or profound change in a
natural ecosystem’s species composition, structure, or function.
18 Calculated as the aggregated volumes of beef, soy sourced for chicken feed,
palm oil, coffee and primary fiber-based guest packaging that are supporting
deforestation-free supply chains, as a percentage of the aggregated total
volumes sourced of these commodities.

food safety protocols. To help us achieve traceability, we work closely with our suppliers,
utilizing standards like the Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) certification, the Supplier
Quality Management System (SQMS) and Distributor Quality Management Process (DQMP).
In addition, all McDonald’s restaurants receive unannounced third-party food safety audits.
During 2023:
1,800+ third-party
audits were performed in 2023
through the Company’s SQMS,
of which McDonald’s standards
were fully met by over 90% of the
food suppliers.
199 farmers globally
were certified to McDonald’s
GAP standards.
250+ distribution centers
completed third-party food safety
and quality audits in 2023. Over
98% were found to be operating
consistently with the McDonald’s
DQMP audit standard.
60,000+ food safety audits
were conducted at McDonald’s
restaurants in 2023.

Our Strategy in Brief
We work to source and serve safe food and
beverages each day, building trust as we strive
to achieve food safety excellence.
Our Global Food Safety Strategy centers on
three operating principles:
1 Customer obsessed: Food Safety is our
#1 priority and is always a focus area.
The safety of McDonald’s food, and
that of the customers who consume it,
is imperative.
2 One McDonald’s way: Our food safety
systems and standards, which are based
on science and validated by external
third parties, are designed to help ensure
a globally aligned approach.
3 Committed to lead: We help lead the
advancement of food safety from farm
to customer and deploy processes to
help us anticipate and manage potential
food safety-related risks.
We execute this strategy through our food safety
work. Our actions help build long-term brand
trust by focusing on two strategic areas:
1 Strengthening our food safety culture.
2 Proactive food safety risk
management.
We are supporting these strategic areas through
the periodic improvement of our standards
and policies, based on current science and
industry best practices. We are monitoring and
identifying innovations and technology to help
strengthen our systems and drive simplification
where possible to help improve behaviors
and performance.

on our website.
Our Performance
Advancing Food Safety Risk
Management
The Company’s food safety risk management
(FSRM) dashboard provides the Food Safety and
Quality teams with the information and data they
need to develop plans for mitigating risks.
In 2023, we established and communicated
global food safety key performance indicators
(KPIs). These included KPIs on topics such as
public recalls and audit performance, which
strongly connect with the brand trust.
Another global KPI requires that every market
should establish a Food Safety Risk Mitigation
Plan. These plans will help ensure that each
market remains focused on locally relevant
risks and areas for improvement, based on key
information such as regulatory developments,
existing gaps and supply chain conditions. In
the first year, most markets reported that they
had established such plans.
Assessing Digital Systems
We are currently evaluating the digital platforms
we use to monitor and measure adherence to
our food safety standards.
As of the end of 2023, as part of our Digital
Food Safety (DFS) initiative, 96% of McDonald’s
restaurants had fully implemented the move
from paper-based to digital food safety
checklists. This supports the production of
real-time reports to help identify potential food
safety risks and prompt timely remedial action.
Building on Our Food
Safety Culture
We believe that running great restaurants
and serving safe food is the basis for building
strong brand trust. We embed strict food
safety standards and protocols in the
Company’s processes from food sourcing
to menu development, packaging and
distribution and the running of McDonald’s
restaurants. We are embracing technology and
working closely with suppliers and external
experts to help improve efficiency and reduce
risks. We share our knowledge both internally
and externally.
In 2023, we analyzed the results of a 2022 food
safety culture assessment and translated
the findings into a global food safety culture
action plan. In 2023, we added a requirement
to the SQMS that suppliers are responsible for
conducting food safety culture assessments
for their own organizations and implementing
necessary responsive actions. At the end
of 2023, more than 80% of the Company’s
suppliers had conducted a food safety
culture assessment.

Examples of the Company’s Commitment
to Food Safety in 2023
• McDonald’s participated in the 18th Global Food
Safety Summit in Barcelona, Spain, coordinated
by the European Networking Group (ENG).
One of our team members presented on risk
assessment implementation plans as a key
factor for customers and brand protection.
• McDonald’s has been on the Fruits and
Vegetable Technical Committee with
the Global Good Agriculture Program
(GLOBALG.A.P.) since 2017 and, in 2023,
remained an active participant to continually
improve global agriculture practice standards.
• McDonald’s played a leading role in founding
SSAFE – and has been an active participant
since – to develop a food safety culture
assessment tool for any company to leverage.
We shared this with our suppliers globally.
Engaging With the Company’s Supply Chain
McDonald’s expects its food suppliers to
complete and meet SQMS standards and, in the
case of higher-risk foods, an additional Good
Manufacturing Practices (GMP) audit. When we
identify specific gaps between our suppliers and
GMP standards, we follow up with scheduled
online webinars or calibration sessions.
In May 2023, the Food Safety team played an
active role in the Global Supply Chain Supplier
Summit, helping to educate Supply Chain teams
on food safety risk management and food safety
culture. The Food Safety team also conducted
the following training sessions in 2023:
• SQMS training for a protein supplier.
• Restaurant food safety training in Europe.
• Food safety packaging training for 15 Latin
American markets.
In 2023, the Company facilitated third-party
food safety audits of suppliers to help verify that
they were following the Company’s food safety
and quality standards. Over 90% of audited
suppliers were found to be meeting McDonald’s
audit standards for SQMS.
We continue to be forward-looking regarding our
food safety standards. Historically, we have used
our connection to industry partners, academia
and regulatory authorities around the world to
anticipate science- and risk-based intelligence
to evolve them. We have progressively matured
our standards, each time benchmarking against
the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) to ensure
ongoing relevance.
Next Steps
While we are proud of the progress we’ve made
to date, our food safety journey is far from over.
Moving forward, we will maintain food safety as
a key part of our always-on goals, highlighting
the continued importance of, and focus on, food
safety improvements.
As we move into 2024 and beyond, we plan
to focus on executing our food safety
culture action plan and aim to identify additional
areas of focus to further strengthen our
efforts. We also plan to leverage insights and
data enhancement efforts from 2023 to begin
updating and automating our data collection
processes to help support better auditing
and reporting.

Nutrition & Marketing Practices
We help feed millions of
people every day, with a
focus on offering families
the choices they love.
McDonald's mission is to make
delicious feel-good moments easy for
everyone. We listen to our customers
and evaluate our menu to identify
ways to evolve our offerings while
maintaining the great taste people
know and love.
Our 2023 Progress
Across our 20 major markets1:
In 2023, 61% of Happy Meal
Bundle Offerings met our Global
Happy Meal Nutrition Criteria for
balanced meals. These criteria mean
meals must have less than or equal
to 600 calories, 10% of calories from
saturated fat, 650 mg of sodium and
10% of calories from added sugar.
In 2023, we maintained the
removal of artificial flavors,
added colors from artificial
sources and artificial
preservatives where feasible2
from Happy Meal Offerings in our
20 in-scope markets.
100% of Happy Meal nutrition
information was available on all
participating market websites and
mobile apps as of Q1 2024.
99% of Happy Meal Bundles
shown in advertisements on
third-party media met our Global
Nutrition Criteria.
We featured water, milk or juice as
the Happy Meal beverage, and fruit,
vegetable or dairy items as one of the
Happy Meal sides in 100% of the ads
the Company directed to children.

Introduction Our Planet Food Quality & Sourcing Jobs, Inclusion & Empowerment Community Connection Appendix
Our Strategy in Brief
We believe parents are looking for menu choices
they can feel good about when it comes to
feeding their kids. That’s why, in accordance
with our values, we’ve been making balanced
meals more accessible to families across the
world by offering options that contribute to
recommended food groups, such as fruits,
vegetables and low-fat dairy.
In 2018, we set five goals to evolve our Happy
Meal over a five-year period. We published an
independent Global Happy Meal Goals report
announcing our significant progress on those
goals, across 20 major markets from 2018–2022.
As we move forward, we will continue monitoring
performance of our 20 major markets against
the following key measures of progress:
• Offer balanced meals.
• Maintain simplified ingredients.
• Be transparent with Happy Meal
nutrition information.
• Market responsibly.
Informed by the last five years, we will no longer
continue reporting on Happy Meal sales data. We
will continue to encourage markets to leverage
innovative marketing, finding new ways to offer
and promote items.
Read more about our Nutrition and Marketing
strategy on our website.
As we look to the future, McDonald’s will
continue to evaluate how our strategy can
evolve to meet changing customer needs and
preferences, building on the progress we have
made to date.
Our Performance
1. Offer Balanced Meals
We aim to ensure 50% or more of the Happy
Meal Bundle Offerings listed on menus in each
of the in-scope markets meet McDonald’s
Global Happy Meal Nutrition Criteria.
In 2023, 61% of Happy Meal Bundle Offerings, on
average, met the Nutrition Criteria across the 20
in-scope markets, up from 36% in 2018.3,4
In 2022, one market received an exemption from
fulfilling this goal and two received extensions.
One of these markets has since achieved
this goal, while the other received a further
extension to achieve it by the end of 2024.
CASE STUDIES
Encouraging the Switch From
Soft Drinks to Water in Happy
Meal Menus Across Europe
Since removing soft drinks from Happy
Meal menu boards in 2013, we’ve continued
efforts to promote beverages with no or
low added sugar, such as water and milk.
In 2021, McDonald's restaurants in
Germany and Austria launched a children’s
water offering that featured creative
packaging aimed at encouraging more
consumption of water. Both markets saw
take rates of the kids’ water increase over
12 percentage points from 2020 to 2023,
which also coincided with a decrease in
soft drink take rates during that same
time period.
McDonald's restaurants in Italy and
Switzerland have also seen increases in
take rates of water in the Happy Meal in
recent years, reaching 29% in 2023 in Italy
compared to 25% in 2020, and increasing
over seven percentage points from 2018 to
2023 in Switzerland.
Offering a Variety of Fruit
and Vegetable Options in
the Happy Meal
Many of our markets offer seasonal fruits
and vegetables as a Happy Meal side
choice. By providing a variety of options,
we can help create greater access to
fruits and vegetables for kids to enjoy.
We also leverage creative campaigns
to excite and engage kids and families
about these offerings.
For example, in 2023, Canada introduced a
rotating Happy Meal fruit program so that
kids can enjoy new and different fruits –
including apples, pineapple and cantaloupe
– throughout the year.
Similarly, the U.K. has an “always on” fruit
and vegetable offer, which means there’s
a fruit and vegetable option available as
part of the Happy Meal year-round. In
2023, this included items like cucumber
sticks, pineapple, carrot sticks, apple slices
and grapes.

2. Maintain Simplified
Ingredients
We are proud of the work that we did to remove
100% of artificial flavors, added colors from
artificial sources and artificial preservatives,
where feasible2, from our Happy Meal Offerings
in 2022. We are also proud to have maintained
this achievement throughout 2023 in all 20 in-
scope markets.5 Moving forward, our goal is to
maintain what we have achieved and take steps
to ensure any new Happy Meal Offerings also
meet this standard.
3. Be Transparent With Happy
Meal Nutrition Information
As of Q1 2024, 100% of nutrition information
was available for all markets with websites and
mobile apps. In 2022, two markets were granted
an exemption from publishing one or two
nutrients due to local legislative requirements.
All other nutrient information was published.
4. Market Responsibly
All Happy Meal Bundles advertised to children6
must meet McDonald’s Global Happy Meal
Nutrition Criteria along with applicable local/
regional advertising pledges.
In 2023, 99% of Happy Meal Bundles shown
in advertisements on third-party media met
our Global Nutrition Criteria. Additionally, we
featured water, milk or juice as the Happy Meal
beverage, and fruit, vegetable or dairy items as
one of the Happy Meal sides in 100% of the ads
the Company directed to children.

Responsible Sourcing
We aim to use our scale and
influence to help positively
impact our planet, in
addition to the animals and
people connected to our
supply chain, especially
when sourcing our priority
commodities, which is where
we believe we can have the
greatest impact: beef, soy
for chicken feed, fiber, palm
oil, fish and coffee.
The road to serving McDonald’s menu
items that delight customers is long
and complex. Our global supply chain
spans countries, continents and
industries. We approach responsible
sourcing holistically, understanding
that our work can impact the
livelihoods of people, the health of our
shared planet and the well-being of
animals. We believe we must respect
them all.
Sustainable Sourcing of Our Priority Commodities
In 2023, we continued advancing efforts to responsibly source our priority commodities,
achieving the following:
98.8% of beef sourced for
McDonald’s restaurants supported
deforestation-free supply chains
by the end of the year.7
100% of soy sourced for
the feed of chicken used in
McDonald’s products supported
deforestation-free supply chains
globally.9
99.9% of our ground and
whole bean coffee was
sustainably sourced.11
97.9% of our primary
fiber-based guest packaging
globally was sourced from
recycled or certified sources.8
100% of the palm oil
used in McDonald’s restaurants
and as an ingredient in McDonald’s
products supported the production
of sustainable palm oil.10
93.8% of the fish
sourced for McDonald’s
Filet-O-Fish® sandwich was

Our Strategy in Brief
Our global supply chain presents a range of
opportunities and risks related to topics such as
land, water, animals and people. In the spirit of
one of the Company’s core values, Integrity – We
do the right thing, we support the Company’s
long-term goal to continue providing quality food
to customers.
We take a two-pronged approach to responsible
sourcing. On one side, we consider and manage
risks that could impact supply chain resiliency
and our ability to maintain a reliable supply to our
restaurants and offices. On the other side, we
seek to enhance the potential positive impacts
of the Company’s supply chain – on topics such
as the livelihoods of those who produce our food
and the well-being of the planet and animals
we rely on – by progressing against our wider
Impact Strategy.
We're informing our approach by
participating in several multi-year
regeneration projects.
We aim to deliver responsible sourcing programs
that drive lasting, meaningful outcomes on the
environmental and social issues that are critical
to the Company. To enable this, we focus on
several topics: animal health and welfare; human
rights; business resilience; and nature, forests
and water.
Our Performance
We focus on responsibly sourcing for priority
commodities, recognizing these sourcing
practices as a key driver for progress against
many of our other long-term commitments,
including in the areas of animal health and
welfare; climate; nature, forests and water; and
human rights. Our size and scale also represent
an opportunity to help drive bigger changes
across global food systems.
Supporting and Advancing
Regenerative Agriculture
The strength of our supplier community is
critical to our ability to advance science-based
climate action and drive nature-based solutions
globally. Investing, together with industry peers,
in projects that help support supplier resilience
and contribute to thriving food systems has
become a core part of our sourcing strategy, as
we work to embed regenerative principles across
our supply chain.
We are scaling adoption of regenerative
agriculture projects – projects that aim to
improve soil health and biodiversity, optimize
water availability, drive climate action and help
restore and protect ecosystems. Participating in
several multi-year regenerative projects provides
us with valuable insights and learnings that will
ultimately inform how these practices can be
scaled long term for our business.
Read about our approach to regenerative
agriculture on our Responsible Sourcing
web page.
Supplier Engagement
As part of a five-year pilot initiative with Cargill,
the Walmart Foundation and World Wildlife
Fund (WWF), since 2020, we have invested
$1.6 million to support ranchers in the Northern
Great Plains through the Ranch Systems and
Viability Planning (RSVP) network.
Through RSVP, ranchers have access to a
comprehensive support system designed
to help them develop sustainable grazing
management plans with assistance from on-
the-ground technical experts. They can also
access ecological monitoring, educational
scholarships to attend grazing and soil health
workshops, a grazing management cost-share
program that helps them improve grazing
infrastructure on their ranches and a peer-to-
peer learning network. As of the end of 2023, the
program is working with 86 ranches impacting
over 800,000 acres across Montana, South
Dakota, Nebraska and Wyoming.
Helping Keep Soils Healthy
In collaboration with Cargill, The Nature
Conservancy and Target, we are supporting
row crop farmers in Nebraska to implement
regenerative agriculture practices with the aim
to help mitigate climate change and improve
the resiliency of land. This five-year initiative
is expected to impact 100,000 acres of land
used for corn production. As of the end of 2023,
there were 53 farmers enrolled in the program,
with approximately 23,000 acres implementing
climate-smart practices.
Helping Increase Biodiversity Through
Encouraging Sustainable Grazing and Beef
Sourcing Practices
Increasing biodiversity helps keep our
ecosystem in delicate balance and supports
all life on Earth – boosting resiliency and
adaptability for the planet and our population.
It also plays a crucial role in supporting global
food security.
Grazing practices, such as rotational grazing and
reduced external inputs, increases biodiversity,
benefits land productivity and fertility and helps
combat the impacts of climate change.
McDonald’s Corporation Purpose & Impact Report 2023–2024 38
Introduction Our Planet Food Quality & Sourcing Jobs, Inclusion & Empowerment Community Connection Appendix
Cattle are a vital part of the farm ecosystem,
contributing to soil biology by the trampling of
grass and adding dung to feed soil microbes –
naturally fertilizing the land as they are rotated
from area to area. This approach also supports
habitats for insects and birds, which benefit
overall biodiversity.
Some examples of our work focused on
engaging with beef farmers on the topic of
biodiversity in 2023 include:
• McDonald's Canada partnered with Ducks
Unlimited Canada and Cargill to conserve
Canadian grasslands, with the goal of returning
125,000 acres of cropland to grass and pasture
by 2025. See the 2023 progress announcement
for more information about the efforts.
• For almost 10 years, we have utilized the
CAP’2ER® tool, which is an environmental
footprint calculator that evaluates the positive
and negative environmental impacts within
beef farming, helping to identify where
farmers can work especially to reduce their
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improve
their carbon storage. As of 2023, we have
verified that over 121,000 hectares of land
are being managed to support biodiversity
by more than 1,000 French cattle farms we
source from.
CASE STUDIES
Quantifying the Impact of
Regenerative Grazing Practices
As a founder of Farm Animal Initiative
(FAI) Farms, we have spent over 20 years
contributing to the development of
sustainable farming practices for the food
industry. This has included helping launch
the Adaptive Multi-Paddock (AMP) Grazing
Project in 2020, an initiative that seeks
to demonstrate the benefits of applying
regenerative principles to beef farming.
In 2023, McDonald’s UK & Ireland built on
this groundwork, launching a new project
to share best practices in regenerative
grazing. Involving 11 beef farms, covering
approximately 7,500 acres and over
3,500 cattle in England and Wales, the
project measures the impact of applying
regenerative principles on nature, soil,
biodiversity, water, carbon sequestration
and climate resilience.
Partnering for Regenerative
Potato Farming
When it comes to advancing responsible
farming practices across our supply
chain and wider industry, we recognize
the invaluable opportunity partnerships
present. For over two years, we have been
an active member of the Sustainable
Markets Initiative and its Agribusiness
Task Force. Through the Task Force, we
collaborate with other global brands – as
well as financial institutions – to accelerate
and derisk adoption of regenerative
agriculture practices.
For example, we teamed up with our
supplier and fellow Task Force member
McCain Foods to launch the Sustainable
Fries Fund, a £1 million joint investment
to help U.K. potato growers adopt more
sustainable practices. Through the Fund,
growers can access grants to invest in soil
health, water efficiency and regenerative
agriculture research. We have also worked
with McCain through a $1 million Future of
Potato Farming Fund to similarly incentivize
Canadian growers.
This collaboration is an important example
of the positive impact direct, farm-level
investments can have on regenerative
agriculture adoption. By helping to reduce
financial burden for farmers and engaging
them on best practice approaches, we can
help scale regenerative farming across the
potato farms that make our fries possible.

Animal Health & Welfare and
Responsible Antibiotic Use
The health and welfare of
animals in the Company’s
supply chain is a priority.
We believe serving safe, quality
food requires sourcing animals that
are properly cared for throughout
their lives. This is why the Company
prioritizes animal health and welfare
and responsible antibiotic use in
food animals.
We have worked to promote antibiotic
stewardship and reduce use since
2003, when we first published our
global policy prohibiting routine use
for growth promotion.
Progress in Our Animal Supply Chain
We aim to source beef and dairy, chicken, eggs and pork from suppliers who share the Company’s values.
Our expectations, including with respect to animal health and welfare, are outlined in our policies, standards
and/or specifications for raw materials and finished products.
Beef: We have established
market-specific targets for
responsible antibiotic use in our
beef supply chain for 10 in-scope
markets and begun partnering to
establish measurement systems
to track future progress.13
Pork: As of the end of 2023, the
U.S. pork supply chain was over 96%
of the way to our goal of phasing
out the use of gestation stalls for
housing confirmed pregnant sows
by the end of 2024.
Eggs: We have achieved 100%
cage-free eggs for our U.S. market,
two years ahead of schedule.
Chicken: HPCIA14 use has been
eliminated from chicken served in
Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe,
Japan, South Korea and the U.S.
We are also on track to achieve our Broiler Welfare
Commitments by the end of 2024:
• Achieved: We have completed large-scale
commercial trials to study the effects of
production parameters on welfare outcomes.
• Achieved and ongoing: We have established
our Chicken Sustainability Advisory Council
(CSAC) and defined farm-level Key Welfare
Indicators (KWIs).
• On track: We continue to develop state-of-the-art
welfare measurement technology, introduce more
enrichments to support natural chicken behavior,
implement Controlled Atmospheric Stunning (CAS)
and third-party on-farm auditing, and assess the
feasibility of extending these commitments to
additional markets.

Our Performance
GOAL
In the U.S., we’re working with pork
suppliers to phase out the use of
gestation stalls (small, enclosed
pens) for housing pregnant sows
by the end of 2024.
PROGRESS
As of the end of 2023, more than
96% of our pork purchased in the
U.S. comes from suppliers that have
phased out the use of gestation
stalls for housing confirmed
pregnant sows.
This marks continued significant progress on
our journey to maximize the time pregnant
sows spend in a group environment. Our
commitment is guided by the industry and
American Association of Swine Veterinarians
(AASV)-endorsed definition for group housing
for pregnant sows. In 2023, McDonald’s bought
more than 230 million pounds of pork from
producers that house pregnant sows in groups.
We remain committed to this journey and are on
track to achieve our target by the end of 2024.
COMMITMENT
We are committed to sourcing
chickens raised with improved
welfare outcomes. To achieve this,
we have outlined eight specific
commitments for our in-scope
markets, which are expected to
be fully implemented by the end
of 2024.15
PROGRESS
We are on track to achieve our 2024
Broiler Welfare Commitments across
in-scope markets. As of the end of
2023, in-scope markets represented
more than 58% of our global
chicken supply.
These commitments apply to chicken raised
for sale at McDonald’s restaurants in Australia,
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, the
Netherlands, Poland, South Korea, Spain,
Switzerland, the U.K. and the U.S.

was a huge undertaking – made
uniquely possible by our Owner/
Operators, Cargill and its egg
producers, and our supply chain
working together as one team.
I am incredibly proud of what
we achieved together and the
positive impact we will continue
to make on the path toward a
more sustainable future. ”
Bob Stewart, Senior Vice President and Chief Supply Chain
Officer, North America, McDonald’s USA
GOAL
The U.S. has a goal of sourcing 100%
cage-free eggs by the end of 2025.
PROGRESS Achieved early
As of the end of 2023, McDonald’s
USA has achieved its commitment
of sourcing 100% cage-free eggs
for items served on its breakfast
menus by 2025 – two years ahead
of schedule.
GOAL
In collaboration with our suppliers,
producers and farmer partners, we
will establish market-appropriate
targets for use of medically important
antibiotics – as defined by the World
Health Organization (WHO) – in our
beef supply chain, and we will partner
in the collection of antibiotic use data
and measurement of progress on
responsible use associated with the
beef industry globally.
PROGRESS
We are collaborating with suppliers
to collect antibiotic use data
associated with global beef
industries, leveraging independent
third parties to facilitate data
aggregation.
Currently, there is limited data on antibiotic
use in the beef industry. Our intention is to
help drive positive behavioral change and
transparency, as well as enable comprehensive
assessment of antibiotic use across our in-
scope beef supply chains. In December 2022,
we established market-specific targets for the
responsible use of antibiotics in our beef supply
chain for 10 in-scope markets (representing over
80% of our global beef supply chain as of the
end of 2022).14 These targets were informed by
insights from beef antibiotic monitoring
pilot tests and in collaboration with subject
matter experts.
Our targets focus on the responsible use of
medically important antibiotics and are aligned
with WHO guidelines on antimicrobial resistance
(AMR). Our policy does not permit the routine
use of medically important antibiotics for the
purpose of growth promotion or the habitual
use of antibiotics for disease prevention.16
During 2023, the Company’s supply chain
worked to identify and enhance access to data
that will help enable future measurement of
antibiotic use and trends over time in our supply
chain. For example, in the U.S. and Canada, we
have identified key suppliers for a multi-year
initiative aimed at working with processor
and farmer participants to launch a new data
interface for various supply chain levels. This
project would create a platform for suppliers and
other partners to provide data, enabling wide-
reaching measurement capabilities that don’t
currently exist in the industry. In the U.K. and
some other European markets such as France,
Germany and Poland, some of our suppliers
are already participating in annual mandatory
reporting of their antibiotic use progress. We
are working to understand how we can use
this existing tracking and reporting to measure
progress toward the Company’s targets.

Introduction Our Planet Food Quality & Sourcing Jobs, Inclusion & Empowerment Community Connection Appendix
We are actively advancing data collection while
accounting for the needs of our suppliers and
their animals. In addition to looking at total
antibiotic use across our in-scope markets, we
are exploring the drivers of antibiotic use, such
as disease pressures, weather impacts or other
external factors. With the health and welfare
of animals at the forefront of our approach, it
is critical to take the time to understand these
nuances to help ensure we implement our
standards in ways that promote responsible use
while continuing to positively impact animal
health and welfare.
For more detail about our approach and
strategy, read more about responsible
antibiotic use on our website.
GOAL
Eliminate the use of antibiotics
defined by the WHO as Highest
Priority Critically Important
Antibiotics (HPCIAs) to human
medicine from all chicken served
in in-scope markets by the end
of 2027.17
PROGRESS
Across the in-scope markets, HPCIA
use has been eliminated in Australia,
Brazil, Canada, Europe, Japan,
South Korea and the U.S., with China
expected to comply before the end
of 2027.
Progress on Broiler Welfare
Commitments
In 2017, we established eight commitments for
broiler welfare, designed to support our wider
global commitment to source chickens raised
with improved welfare outcomes. During 2022,
we published an interim update on our progress
and, throughout 2023, have continued to track
against each of our commitments. We will
publish final updates in 2025, in line with our aim
of fully implementing these commitments by
the end of 2024.
McDonald’s Corporation Purpose & Impact Report 2023–2024 43
Introduction Our Planet Food Quality & Sourcing Jobs, Inclusion & Empowerment Community Connection Appendix
Our Eight Commitments to Broiler Welfare
2024 Commitment Progress as of the end of 2023
1. Establishing the McDonald’s
Chicken Sustainability Advisory
Council (CSAC)
Status: Achieved, Ongoing
The McDonald’s CSAC supports our continued journey to improve animal welfare standards by providing
crucial insights and knowledge.
McDonald’s launched its CSAC in 2018, made up of 15 researchers, academia, welfare experts,
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and suppliers to provide progressive guidance and credible
counsel. Organizations with members on the CSAC include Farm Animal Initiative (FAI) Farms and World
Wildlife Fund (WWF), as well as leading academics and researchers such as Dr. Temple Grandin and
Dr. Harry Blokhuis. This Council – and working groups derived from it – convenes regularly and continues
to provide expertise, insight and directional guidance for our broiler welfare and sustainability efforts.
2. Measuring key farm-level welfare
outcomes
Status: Achieved, Ongoing
2019: The CSAC helped define 15 globally aligned farm- and process-level Key Welfare Indicators (KWIs) to
operationalize our strategy. The KWIs measure performance toward our welfare outcomes commitment
and inform progress on our goal.
In partnership with global suppliers and an external third-party facilitator, we concluded an extensive, two-
year commercial trials initiative to study the impacts that certain production parameters – such as breed
and stocking density – have on welfare, environmental and economic outcomes.
2022: We set targets through our KWIs approach, which mean that suppliers will now be ranked in
performance peer groups that will inform timebound improvement goals. The insights gained from our
first three years of data collection were shared with suppliers, with a focus on Systemwide continuous
improvement. As of the end of 2023, we have gathered data on more than 6.8 billion birds.
3. Developing state-of-the-
art welfare measurement technology
Status: On track
These technologies will be among the first of their kind proposed for commercial availability and will help
McDonald’s identify opportunities for improvement in broiler welfare.
McDonald’s has invested nearly $2 million (which enabled an additional $2.6 million in matching funds)
into our Sensing, Monitoring, Analysis, Reporting Technology (SMART) Broiler initiative to automate
gathering animal health and welfare indicators.
Three research projects are now in Phase 2 of development, which will run through Q3 2024.
Throughout this phase of the initiative, McDonald’s will provide researchers with access to funds and
facilities that allow them to continue developing technology that objectively and effectively monitors
broiler welfare and behavior.
4. Providing enrichments to support
natural behavior
Status: On track
We are working with the Company’s supply chain to ensure housing environments help promote natural
behaviors, such as pecking, perching and dust-bathing.
2021–2022: An Enrichments & Lighting Working Group, a subset of our CSAC, developed enrichment and
lighting guidelines for implementation by suppliers.
2022–2023: Suppliers tested lighting and enrichments in commercial settings.
2024 Commitment Progress as of the end of 2023
5. Running commercial trials to study
the effects of certain production
parameters on welfare outcomes
Status: Achieved
2022: We achieved our commitment around conducting commercial trials to study the effects of certain
production parameters – such as breed and stocking density – on welfare, behavior, environmental and
economic outcomes. The results of these science-led, data-driven efforts indicate that changing breed
and stocking density variables could have direct and significant environmental impacts, such as on
emissions and land use change.
These trials were also crucial for informing our KWI target-setting approach, which helps drive continuous
welfare improvement throughout our supply chain.
6. Controlled Atmospheric Stunning
(CAS) in the U.S. and Canada
Status: On track
McDonald’s was one of the first retailers to implement a CAS system into a U.S. broiler supply chain, and
currently 66% of our dedicated processing facilities (four out of six) have been converted. Remaining
facilities are on track to be onboarded by the end of 2024. CAS is a U.S. Department of Agriculture-
approved method that is recognized to be humane for the animal while also ensuring better conditions for
workers.
100% of our Canadian broiler volumes have been converted to CAS. CAS is in use across 100% of our
Canadian supply chain facilities and is already practiced by many approved suppliers for McDonald’s
restaurants in Europe and Australia.
7. Implementing third-party
on-farm auditing
Status: On track
We have initiated a process to define, then implement, our third-party on-farm auditing protocol by the
end of 2024.
As we implement our global broiler welfare standards, we will establish third-party verification to enable
continuous improvement.
2023: We developed and tested an audit tool focusing on our new welfare requirements. These results
informed further revisions to the audit tool, development of an auditing protocol and auditor training
materials.
8. Complete an assessment to
measure the feasibility of extending
these commitments to additional
global markets where McDonald’s
operates
Status: On track
Our feasibility assessment is currently underway.
Our work with suppliers includes assessing their capacity to service new markets in line with our animal
welfare policies and guidelines.
McDonald’s Corporation Purpose & Impact Report 2023–2024 44
Introduction Our Planet Food Quality & Sourcing Jobs, Inclusion & Empowerment Community Connection Appendix
Notes
1 Our major markets include Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China,
France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the U.K and the U.S. While initially included
in these 20 markets, Russia was removed in 2022 following our exit from this
market. We subsequently incorporated Mexico into the goal scope, as its
progress was already being monitored and it allowed us to maintain tracking
against 20 markets.
2 McDonald’s top priority is to ensure all items meet strict food safety and quality
standards. “Where feasible” means that by removing an artificial preservative,
there will not be a sacrifice in the food quality or safety standards, value or
taste. In certain cases, it was determined that an artificial preservative was
necessary to ensure the safety, quality, taste or value of the food.
3 Averaged across the 20 major markets.
4 One market was granted an exemption from this goal due to use of a frying oil
that meets local dietary customs. Two markets were granted extensions until
the end of 2023 due to delays in technology to update their ordering channels
(kiosk and mobile app).
5 One market was granted an extension until January 2023 because of supply
chain challenges. This market fulfilled this goal in January 2023.
6 If a local food pledge commitment exists, the “directed to children” definition in
that food pledge applies. In countries without a local food pledge commitment,
for measured media, the following definition applies: Media purchased for
any program or website where the expected audience generally consists of
35% or more of children under the age of 12 years. In unmeasured media,
McDonald’s may consider other factors, as appropriate, to determine whether
the advertising is directed to children, such as the overall impression of the
advertising, the target demographic based on the media plan and whether age
screening applies.
7 Beef. Scope: Includes all beef raw material used in beef patties sourced for
McDonald’s products from beef patty manufacturers that supply McDonald’s
restaurants in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Germany, Ireland, France, New
Zealand, Canada, the U.K. or Poland. Includes all McDonald’s restaurants
owned and operated by the Company and its Franchisees in these countries,
which collectively represent over 80% of our global beef volumes, as of the
end of 2021. The Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB) aims to
define the principles of and criteria for beef sustainability globally. The five
core principles are focused on the following: managing natural resources
responsibly; respecting people and communities; caring for the welfare of
animals; ensuring the safety and quality of beef; and driving efficiency and
innovation to reduce waste and improve economic viability. These principles
allow for national and regional interpretation, given the significant variation in
production systems, legal frameworks, sociopolitical factors and climates that
exist across the globe. Exclusions: Beef used as secondary ingredients.
8 Fiber. Scope: Primary fiber-based packaging refers to products that are used
to package guest food on premises at McDonald’s restaurants. This type of
packaging includes containers, cups, wraps, bags for food, beverages, napkins,
folding cartons, clamshells, food service bags, napkins, salad bowls, Happy
Meal cartons, drink carriers and cup carriers. Includes all suppliers of primary-
based packaging to the McDonald’s System and all McDonald’s restaurants
owned and operated by the Company and its Franchisees. In 2021, the primary
fiber-based packaging scope was expanded to include plastic alternatives
such as wood stirrers and cutlery, and paper straws and lids. This broadened
scope has resulted in a slight decrease in percent compliance. All volumes of
contingency items sourced from suppliers compliant with our standards but
not integrated into our data reporting system were counted as non-compliant.
Countries with regions currently identified as high-deforestation priority
regions for fiber include Argentina, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Russia and Vietnam. McDonald’s requires all wood fiber sourced from these
regions to be Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®) certified or FSC® controlled
wood sources with full chain of custody certification. Exclusions: Primary
fiber-based packaging in food packaged off-site McDonald’s restaurants; tray
liners, straws and limited locally sourced items.
9 Soy (for chicken feed). Scope: Includes all soybean volume used in the feed
of chicken sourced for McDonald’s products by all chicken suppliers to the
McDonald’s System and all McDonald’s restaurants owned and operated by
the Company and its Franchisees that sell chicken. Europe refers to Austria,
Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,
Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia,
Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Moldova, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland,
Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
the U.K. and Ukraine. Countries with regions currently identified as high-
deforestation priority regions for soy include Argentina (Chaco biome),
Brazil (Amazon and Cerrado biomes) and Paraguay (Chaco biome). Given the
complexity of soy supply chains, we consider that, unless demonstrated, all of
McDonald’s sources of soy for chicken feed fall into high-deforestation priority
regions, with the exception of chicken sourced in North America, where soy
used in chicken feed is locally produced and considered low risk. Exclusions:
Soy used as an ingredient in McDonald’s products sold in restaurants, for
example, soy oil.
10 Palm oil. Scope: Includes all palm oil (including crude palm oil, palm kernel
oil, derivatives and fractions) sourced for McDonald’s restaurants for use
as restaurant cooking oil and all palm oil sourced by McDonald’s suppliers
and used directly as an ingredient in a McDonald’s product and listed on the
product’s ingredient statement. Includes all suppliers of products containing
palm oil in the McDonald’s System and all McDonald’s restaurants owned and
operated by the Company and its Franchisees that use palm oil. All countries
are currently identified as high-deforestation priority regions for palm oil and
all volumes are required to be covered by Roundtable on Sustainable Palm
Oil (RSPO) certification or credits. All RSPO supply chain models applicable
to RSPO are applicable to McDonald’s ‒ RSPO Identity Preserved (IP), RSPO
Segregated (SG), RSPO Mass Balance (MB) and Book and Claim (BC) ‒ although
McDonald’s is committed to increasing traceability by specifying physical
certification for the palm oil used in the McDonald’s System in the greatest
volumes (IP, SG or MB). Exclusions: Palm oil, palm kernel oil or their derivative
used as secondary ingredients in McDonald’s products. This is when palm oil is
used as an ingredient within an ingredient, for example, an emulsifier.
11 Coffee. Scope: Includes all ground and whole bean coffee, including
decaffeinated coffee, used in espresso-based drinks and coffee brewed at
McDonald’s restaurants, and all ground and whole bean coffee in McDonald’s-
branded retail products. Includes all suppliers of coffee to the McDonald’s
System. Market scope includes all McDonald’s restaurants owned and
operated by the Company and its Franchisees that sell coffee, and retail
outlets selling McDonald’s-branded coffee products. Countries with regions
currently identified as high-deforestation priority regions for coffee include
Honduras, Indonesia and Vietnam. McDonald’s requires all coffee sourced from
these regions to be Rainforest Alliance Certified. Exclusions: Coffee extracts
and ingredients used in products such as frappés and coffee in baked goods;
coffee in cold brew drinks if they are brewed off-site; coffee extract in ready-to-
drink retail products; and other locally sourced products containing coffee.
12 Fish: Fish refers to any type of fish species used as an ingredient in a
McDonald’s product and listed on the product’s ingredient statement. Wild-
Caught Fish refers to fish that come from seas, rivers and other natural
bodies of water. Filet-O-Fish sandwich refers to the McDonald’s menu item
containing wild-caught fish. Verified sustainable sources refers to wild-
caught fish, sourced by suppliers to the McDonald’s System, from fisheries that
are annually verified as compliant with the McDonald’s Sustainable Fisheries
Standard by the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership. MSC Certification is
optional to McDonald’s markets. Fisheries may also be independently certified
as meeting the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) Principles and Criteria for
Sustainable Fishing where a certificate of conformity to an MSC Standard
has been granted. Source: www.msc.org. McDonald’s may display the MSC
certification logo in some of its markets where fisheries and restaurants are
certified against the MSC Chain of Custody traceability standard. Scope:
Includes all wild-caught fish sourced for Filet-O-Fish sandwich portions served
in McDonald’s restaurants. Filet-O-Fish sandwich portions represents over 97%
of the total fish volumes used in the McDonald’s System (by weight). Includes
all suppliers of wild-caught fish for Filet-O-Fish sandwich to the McDonald’s
System and all McDonald’s restaurants owned and operated by the Company
and its Franchisees that sell fish. Exclusions: Products that are not Filet-O-Fish
sandwich containing wild-caught or farmed fish. We estimate that these
products represent less than 2% of the total fish sourced by McDonald’s by
weight and may include products such as tuna, prawns, shrimp, salmon and
calamari; other breaded products; and locally sourced products. The Company
has set an expectation that these products are sustainably sourced, although
they are not included in this global performance measure given the local, and
often promotional, nature of these items. Moving forward, we have plans in
place to reduce sourcing from non-compliant fisheries and will increase our
supply of fish sourced from compliant fisheries as new facility options become
available.
13 Beef antibiotic use: This goal focuses on Australia, Brazil, Canada, France,
Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, Poland, the U.K. and the U.S., which
represented our top 10 beef sourcing countries and accounted for over 80% of
our global beef supply chain as of the end of 2022.
14 Antibiotics defined by the WHO as Highest Priority Critically Important
Antibiotics (HPCIA).
15 Broiler welfare: These commitments apply to chickens raised for sale at
McDonald’s restaurants in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland,
the Netherlands, Poland, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, the U.K. and the U.S.
Russia has been removed from the scope of this goal based on our 2022 exit
from this market.
16 Beef antibiotic use: Habitual use of medically important antibiotics for
disease prevention is a probable indication of an underlying herd-specific and/
or management issue and is not permitted except in the following narrowly
defined situations: based upon the determination of a qualified veterinarian
familiar with the disease history in the herd, non-routine prevention uses may
be permitted if there is a high risk of contraction of a particular infectious
disease. If use is deemed necessary and when effective multiple treatment
options exist, McDonald’s encourages adoption of a tiered approach to
antibiotic selection – least important to human medicine being the first choice,
with HPCIAs reserved for last resort. See Antibiotic Policy for our Beef Supply
Chain for further information.
17 Chicken antibiotic use: Markets covered by this goal include Brazil, Canada,
Japan, South Korea, the U.S., Australia, China and Europe. For the purposes
of this goal, Europe includes Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia,
the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany,
Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Moldova,
the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia,
Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, the U.K. and Ukraine. As of December 2023,
Belarus, Bosnia & Herzegovina and Kazakhstan have been removed from the
scope of this goal based on our exit from those markets.

Introduction Our Planet Food Quality & Sourcing Jobs, Inclusion & Empowerment Community Connection Appendix
Our Strategy in Brief
McDonald’s has developed an approach that
focuses on issues relevant to its business,
embeds key activities to address those issues
within McDonald’s corporate functions and
market operations, and provides flexibility to
respond to emerging human rights-related
trends and business priorities.
Regardless of cultural, social or economic
context, we conduct our activities in a way that
respects the dignity of each person. To maintain
relevant policies and practices, we work to
identify and understand the human rights issues
that are most important to our business.
Foundational to our human rights approach
are the United Nations Guiding Principles
on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).
The UNGPs outlines that businesses should
demonstrate respect for human rights through
five key steps, which the McDonald’s approach is
aligned with:
• Policy and Governance
• Human Rights Due Diligence
• Integrate Findings
• Track and Report
• Provide Effective Remedy
As well as our Human Rights Policy, McDonald’s
wider human rights approach has been
developed and informed by third-party human
rights assessments, ongoing analysis of the
emerging business and regulatory landscape
on human rights, and extensive consultation
with subject matter experts across the business.
As we continue to evolve our human rights
approach, we’re committed to employee and
stakeholder engagement to inform our own
policy and influence change elsewhere.
Our Policies and Standards
Our commitment to respect human rights is
set out in our Human Rights Policy. The policy
is in line with the UNGPs. We respect rights and
principles as outlined in the International Bill
of Human Rights and the International Labour
Organization’s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental
Principles and Rights at Work, the Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
Against Women and the Convention on the
Rights of the Child. We are also signatories to the
Women’s Empowerment Principles.
As well as our commitment to respect people
and their rights, our expectations for suppliers
and Franchisees to do the same are also
outlined in several documents. Together, these
standards, principles and policies reinforce a
culture of integrity and respect, forming the
foundation of our efforts to feed and foster
communities worldwide.
Explore our policies and standards on
our website.

Stakeholder Engagement
To assess and prioritize human rights impacts,
we conduct assessments, monitor media and
third-party reporting and participate in internal
and external stakeholder engagement.
In 2023, we became an Engaged Organization
of the Centre for Sport and Human Rights. The
Centre is a human rights organization with a
mission to advance a world of responsible sport
that fully respects and promotes human rights
by generating awareness around key issues,
building capacity and delivering value-added
impact. Our participation helps us understand
and implement measures to do our part in
preventing human rights violations linked to
sport and major events.
McDonald’s collaborates with the industry
to promote human rights through our active
participation in, and as Co-Chairs of, the
Consumer Goods Forum’s Human Rights
Coalition, which strives to make human
rights due diligence the industry norm in own
operations and supply chains. McDonald’s is
also a member of the Leadership Group for
Responsible Recruitment, a collaborative effort
to drive positive change in how migrant workers
are recruited.
To help ensure our supplier program addresses
emerging human rights issues and risks, we
participate in initiatives such as AIM-Progress,
a business initiative focused on responsible
sourcing. Beyond industry partnerships, our
Supplier Workplace Accountability program is
complemented by mechanisms that enable
collaboration on a risk-based approach to
high-risk sourcing regions or commodities.
This includes sourcing our largest food and
packaging volumes through internationally
recognized third-party certification schemes
that respect human rights and communities in
their certification process.
Learn more about certifications for
our high-priority commodities on our
Responsible Sourcing web page.
Progress Against Our
Focus Areas
Oversight of Employment
of Minors
McDonald’s Supplier Code of Conduct states
that suppliers shall ensure no underage labor,
as defined in the Code, has been used in the
production or distribution of their goods or
services. We periodically evaluate ways to
strengthen our auditing process. In 2023, for
example, McDonald’s engaged third-party
supplier auditors to conduct night shift audits
at select facilities in the U.S. to help increase
visibility and oversight.
Encouraging Customers
to Speak Up
McDonald’s restaurant employees are trained
to create a safe, respectful environment for
anyone visiting a restaurant, including our
customers. McDonald’s promotes customer-
facing surveys on many receipts. In 2023,
McDonald’s received over 100 million survey
responses via its global customer satisfaction
survey platform used in more than
100 markets. Some restaurants have also
deployed their own customer feedback
mechanisms, and McDonald’s makes
customer-facing contact information
available at restaurant, national and global
levels. These mechanisms provide an avenue
for customers to raise complaints about
discrimination or harassment if experienced
at a McDonald’s restaurant.
Working Conditions
for Suppliers
McDonald’s values opportunities to partner
with suppliers to move beyond compliance,
especially to foster conditions related to
the promotion of work-life balance. With
McDonald’s support, some Happy Meal toy
production facilities in China partnered with
ICTI Ethical Toy Program and The Centre for
Child Rights and Business to run Family Friendly
Spaces (FFS) in their facilities. This program
is about reuniting “left behind” children with
their parents who are migrant workers in
toy production facilities during the summer
holidays. In 2023, nine McDonald’s suppliers
participated in FFS with 340 children.

Our Performance
We are committed to supporting restaurants
(whether Company-owned and operated or
franchised) and Company offices with safety-
related implementation guidance, including a
suite of policies, tools and training. In 2021, we
supplemented existing respectful workplace
training with a global eLearning module,
“Building a Safe, Respectful and Inclusive
Workplace,” focused on helping prevent
harassment, discrimination and retaliation
in the workplace.
In 2023, we updated our training requirements
for markets outside the U.S. to require that
employees complete training within 30 days
of their first shift.
Also in 2023, Putting People First was
established as a standalone assessment
visit in international markets. Assessing
people standards separately helps the
Franchisee consultants put the necessary
attention on adherence to the Company’s
people-related requirements.

our employees. And, because we know that
ambition is nothing without action, we underpin
our commitment to our employees with robust
policies and practices that are designed to
foster an inclusive environment and to fuel their
career development.
Inclusive Leadership
We are prioritizing the development of inclusive
leaders. Since 2022, we have offered an
Inclusive Leadership course for employees in
Director-level positions and above. The inclusive
leadership offerings are a supplement to the
on-demand online courses, virtual employee-
led courses and a variety of other learning
resources available from our learning and
development team.
Promoting Inclusive
Recruitment, Hiring and
Promotion Processes
We seek to embed various practices into our
hiring and promotion processes to help promote
access to opportunities. For example, to create
awareness of opportunities with our brand in the
United States, we drive on-campus partnerships
with various institutions, including those serving
minorities, prioritize the inclusiveness of our job
postings, and attend a variety of career fairs and
workshops aimed at attracting top talent. We also
design interviews and interview guides to help
support equity and fairness throughout selection,
interview and offer processes.
Internally, we promote job visibility to support
access to growth opportunities. We maintain
Job Posting Guidelines outlining our requirement
that, subject to limited exceptions, all roles in the
U.S. (levels G6 and below) must be posted for five
days. By setting this expectation, we help drive
awareness of internal opportunities.

Development and
Succession Plans
We take tangible steps to develop our talent
pipeline to help ensure employees of all
backgrounds are able to achieve their full
potential at the Company.
Corporate officers are asked to take steps
to put intentional succession plans in place
to support the pipeline for leadership roles
throughout the organization. The expectations
are that these succession plans are an
honest, viable, actionable depiction of the
true readiness of the pipeline and provide
employees with the support needed for
upward advancement.
Leadership Accountability
and Governance
We’re serious about holding ourselves and our
leaders accountable for driving an inclusive
culture, and doing so in accordance with local
regulations and employment laws around
the world.
To reinforce the importance of the Company’s
values, the Company’s annual incentive plan
includes financial performance metrics, as well
as strategic measures that hold executives
accountable for efforts toward the Company’s
DEI ambitions.
Board Diversity
Due to the global and complex nature of our
business, our Board believes it is imperative
that its composition embodies a diverse set
of viewpoints, perspectives, and experiences
to most effectively discharge its business
oversight responsibility. Our Board also believes
having Directors of different genders, races and
ethnicities contributes positively to its balance
and effectiveness.
As of the end of 2023, more than half of our

Equal Pay for Equal Work
GOAL
McDonald’s commits to close pay
gaps identified in annual equal
pay analyses for women globally
in Company-owned and operated
markets and for Underrepresented
Groups in the U.S. at Staff and
Company-owned and operated
restaurant levels.
PROGRESS
Results of the 2023 pay gap
analysis demonstrated continuous
annual progress: women globally
in Company-owned and operated
markets were paid, on average,
99.96 cents on the dollar in base
pay of what men were paid for
similar work. Further, there was
no base pay gap disfavoring
Underrepresented Groups in the
U.S. These results indicate the
Company substantially attained
equal pay, and in 2024, intends to
close the small gaps identified in
line with our commitment.11
We believe in compensating people fairly for
the work they do, regardless of gender or any
other protected characteristic. Compensation
for Company employees – including both
Corporate Staff and Company-owned and
operated restaurant employees – is established
based on factors that legitimately drive
differences in pay between employees, such
as relevant market conditions, job level,
experience, performance and location.
We publicly stated our ongoing commitment to
equal pay in 2021, supported by an annual pay
gap analysis that aims to ensure equitable pay
practices across the Company.

Franchisee Diversity Initiatives
Around the World
Several countries took action in 2023 to help
support Franchisee diversification efforts.
For example, McDonald’s UK & Ireland
(UK&I) has set an ambition to be a “Best
in Class Franchisor” while also aiming to
diversify its Franchisee community. To help
drive recruitment of diverse Franchisees,
McDonald’s UK&I has focused on showcasing
franchise opportunities through internal and
external communications.
McDonald’s Australia recently announced an
investment of approximately $600 million to
open 100 new restaurants by the end of 2025.
To keep pace with these ambitious growth
targets, the business is actively recruiting new
Franchisees. This includes external business
leaders, as well as a focus on developing
high-potential talent from within the
System, and creating clear pathways toward
franchise ownership for Corporate Staff and
Restaurant Staff.
“
McDonald’s is a great system and
I’m especially excited to mentor
and train our young employees.
I am excited to roll my sleeves
up and make a mark on
Geraldton, Australia.
From a 14-year-old crew person
starting at McDonald’s in a casual
job while I was at school to 23 years
later becoming a McDonald’s
Franchisee, this is nothing short
of a dream come true.
”
Katie Nicholson, Franchise Owner
Suppliers
To help bring about real impact, we work with a
diverse range of suppliers who share our values.
We fully understand that a chance to work
with McDonald’s is one that can change the
trajectory of a business, so we continually look
to welcome new businesses into our supplier
network. We invite U.S.-based suppliers to
share our dedication to DEI, demonstrating
their shared focus by signing a Mutual
Commitment to DEI (MCDEI) pledge. As of the
end of 2023, 540 U.S.-based suppliers have
signed the MCDEI pledge. McDonald’s U.S.
systemwide spend with U.S.-based MCDEI
signatories was $15.6 billion in 2023.
During 2023, we also continued our work to
engage and celebrate suppliers living the value
of inclusion. This included launching a supplier
newsletter where we highlight impactful
stories demonstrating how our suppliers are
championing inclusion and the impact that has
for their organizations and communities.

Our Strategy in Brief
McDonald’s vision is to be an iconic talent
destination – known as much for its people
experience as for the Golden Arches. Based on
our belief that the employee experience can
positively impact the customer experience,
we are relentlessly focused on running great
restaurants, empowering our people and
continuing to modernize our ways of working.
We have designed and are deploying strategic
human resources and talent management
processes that help support our long-term
business strategy.
Key to this strategy has been the development
of an initiative to build the foundation for a
seamless, personalized employee experience
and to transition our talent processes to a
digital format. This initiative will establish
“Glocal” (globally leveraged and locally relevant)
processes and simplify the Company’s
technology landscape with four transformation
objectives: elevate the McDonald’s employee
experience; gain efficiency; improve workforce
management; and enable advanced data
analytics, insights and reporting. Achieving these
objectives will help create internal visibility into
the full breadth of talent at the Company.
See the Talent & Benefits strategy and
programs in detail on our website.
Our Performance
We’re working to improve employee experiences
through smart investments in people,
processes and technology.
We want to create a culture where the
Company’s employees feel empowered to
drive business impact and pursue their career
aspirations. Through the Company’s talent
processes and supporting resources, we are
evolving to help build high-performing and
highly engaged teams.
Career Planning and
Development Philosophy
In 2023, a Career Planning and Development
Philosophy website for Corporate Staff went
live. The website documents the Company’s
commitment to helping its employees on their
career journey through a philosophy deeply
rooted in the Company’s purpose, mission
and values.
The Philosophy guides Company employees in
how to develop their careers and details how the
Company can build strong leadership pipelines.
There are many ways we put it into action: we
have created the Career Navigator guide for
employees to use when exploring tools, services
and offerings available to help their career
journeys; we also provide resources to help
People Managers develop employees’
skills to support their career aspirations.
Annual Career Conversations are opportunities
for Company employees to discuss career plans
with their People Manager and receive guidance
on how to pursue them.
People Manager Connections
We are committed to the growth and
development of our People Managers,
recognizing the key role they can play in
supporting and advancing their teams.
That’s why we launched the People Manager
Connection series – education sessions
designed to help Company employees who
are People Managers explore key topics,
understand what’s expected of them and
learn from one another.
We held seven People Manager Connection
sessions in 2023, which covered important
topics such as Leading through Uncertainty,
Psychological Safety, Managing through
Transitions, Cultural Norms, Career Planning
and Development, Assessing and Rewarding
Talent, and Abridged Accelerate.
Learning and Development
Our learning and development approach is a
competitive advantage to McDonald’s and a true
differentiator to the employee value proposition.
In 2023, Corporate Staff completed 112,000
courses, while Restaurant Staff completed more
than 17 million, including HU restaurant and
leadership curricula, and eLearning courses.
We have taken steps to help make shift leader
training more accessible through additional
class openings and, as a result, the number of
U.S.-based shift leaders trained increased by
25% in 2023 compared to 2022.
Also in 2023, we launched several programs
designed to support employee advancement,
including:
• A Hospitality module in the U.S. for new
Restaurant Staff.
• Activate, a Consulting Great Restaurants
program for global new-to-role
operations-facing consultants.
• Accelerate, a leadership development
experience delivered in 32 sessions to over
900 Directors and above across 17 markets
and regions.
• A Franchisee Development Program.

• Awarded over $200 million in tuition assistance
to Restaurant Staff.
• Awarded tuition assistance to more than
65,000 Restaurant Staff.
• Supported nearly 2,000 graduates of the
Career Online high school program.
• Supported more than 8,800 graduates of
English Under the Arches program.
Compensation and Wages
Market Focus: Restaurant Staff Wages in
the U.S.
During 2023, we designed and proposed a third-
party wage advisory service to be piloted with
a group of U.S.-based Franchisees beginning in
early 2024. The optional wage advisory service is a
Company investment designed to provide U.S.-
based Franchisees with resources and education to
help them make third-party-supported wage and
compensation decisions for their own businesses
based on benchmarking of locally available data.
CASE STUDY
Advocating for the Value of
Archways to Opportunity
Having started at a McDonald’s restaurant
as a crew member 20 years ago, Stephanie
Gafford has since been promoted several
times – to Manager, General Manager and
Training Coordinator, in which she has been
working for over five years. In this Training
Coordinator role, she is an advocate of the
Archways to Opportunity program.
Stephanie completed a BSc in Business
Administration from Colorado Technical
University with the support of Archways
to Opportunity. The university’s program
structure allowed Stephanie to effectively
manage her time throughout the week – she
would spend a few hours on schoolwork and
still be able to handle her work duties and be
with her family.
Now, having completed her degree in
2023, Stephanie’s wish is for more people
to learn about Archways to Opportunity.
Her goal is to remove what she calls
the McDonald’s stereotype: “The
stereotype that people think if you work
at McDonald’s, you are uneducated –
because that’s not true! At McDonald’s we
are educating people.”
“
I have such a passion for
this program that being
able to do this as my job
is truly amazing! ”

Community Impact & Philanthropy
We take our responsibility of
supporting people seriously
‒ because we believe that
when our communities
thrive, so does McDonald’s.
By thinking globally and acting
locally, we can be better equipped
to effectively support anyone who
works at or enters a McDonald’s
restaurant and the communities we
are all a part of.
McDonald's has repeatedly acted
as a resource during times of need –
showing up to help support people in
the communities it serves.
We’ve reached 2.2 million young people with training and hiring
opportunities, achieving our Youth Opportunity goal ahead of time.
As of 2023, we are proud to have reached more than 2 million young people with
support for community-based training and hiring opportunities in McDonald’s
restaurants, two years ahead of our 2025 deadline. As we look to the future, we will
assess potential new opportunities to build on the progress we have made so far.
Other ways we were there
for those in need in 2023
Made an annual pledge of
$1 million to the American Red
Cross Annual Disaster Giving
Program (ADGP).
Donated one penny from every
Happy Meal sold at participating
U.S. restaurants to Ronald

Introduction Our Planet Food Quality & Sourcing Jobs, Inclusion & Empowerment Community Connection Appendix
Our Strategy in Brief
We aim to build strong and inclusive connections
that deliver on the needs of the communities
McDonald’s serves, because we believe that
doing so is consistent with the Company’s
business objectives and values. We are focused
on partnering with organizations that share our
Company’s core values, harnessing our size and
influence to help maximize collective impact
while also strengthening relationships with the
communities we serve.
Our Community Impact & Philanthropy strategy
focuses on three key strategic outcome areas:
1 Supporting families: Help address the needs
of families and their well-being through the
support of Ronald McDonald House Charities.
2 Times of need: Help respond to the needs of
people and communities in the face of crisis
and hardship.
3 Opportunity employment: Help reduce
systemic barriers to employment.

philanthropy on our website.
Our Performance
Representing the Communities
in Which We Operate
Chicago: Contributing at Home
As a large employer headquartered in Chicago,
we believe we have a responsibility to help
address urgent community needs through
strategic investments and engagement. It’s
why we launched a Chicago Community Impact
Grants Program together with The Chicago
Community Trust to invest in neighborhood
organizations advancing youth opportunity. In
2023, we deepened our commitment to 18 of
these organizations, helping to ensure that they
have the resources to support skills development
in young people to ready them for a myriad of
potential career pathways.
Breaking Barriers: Progressive Young Farmers
Over the last 10 years, McDonald’s UK & Ireland
Progressive Young Farmers Program has evolved
to embed diversity, equity and inclusion at its
core. As of August 2023, over 70 young people
have joined the program, including 62% women
and 25% from non-farming backgrounds, each
experiencing 12 months within our supply chain
to kick-start their career in food and farming. In
2020, the program evolved with the launch of
the Breaking Barriers Scholarship in partnership
with the Oxford Farming Conference. In 2023,
five scholarship recipients were offered the
opportunity to see first-hand careers available in
food and farming and to share experiences.
Supporting Communities
in Need
Disaster Response
In 2023, employees from the McDonald’s System
made charitable contributions to support the
American Red Cross relief efforts, including
donations made in response to the wildfires in
Maui, and we donated $40,000 to the Hawaii
Community Foundation’s Maui Strong Fund
to support recovery needs. Additionally, the
Golden Arches Merchants Association of Hawaii
provided $25,000 to impacted McDonald’s
Company and Franchisee employees in Lahaina,
Hawaii, and the Asian McDonald’s Operator
Association donated $25,000 to support local
employees in Hawaii. Company employee
donations totaling over $53,000 were made via
the Company’s online donation portal to support
the American Red Cross’ Hawaii relief efforts.
Through the McOpCo Employee Relief Fund,
we provided financial support to 28 employees
in 2023 following hurricanes, crime, vehicle
accidents, death and domestic abuse.
In 2023, McDonald’s Corporation donated
$500,000 to earthquake relief efforts in Turkey,
including contributions to Save the Children
and World Central Kitchen. The local business
also donated over $200,000 to local charities
to support communities impacted by the
earthquake.
Locally Driven Needs: The Company’s
2023 Actions
We are dedicated to supporting communities in
times of need and have taken several actions to
advance this in 2023, including:
• Renewing the Company’s American Red
Cross Annual Disaster Giving Program
(ADGP) partnership, committing a $1 million
donation to proactively support global disaster
relief efforts.
• Offering hardship and disaster relief for
Company Restaurant Staff in the U.S.
• Donating one penny from every Happy Meal
sold at participating McDonald’s in the U.S. to
RMHC, totaling over $5.9 million.
• Donating $1 million to support the
Founder’s Circle of Operation HOPE, an
organization whose mission is to expand
economic opportunity in underserved
communities through financial education
and empowerment by offering programs that
create stabilized communities and financial
stakeholders.
McDonald’s Corporation Purpose & Impact Report 2023–2024 66
Introduction Our Planet Food Quality & Sourcing Jobs, Inclusion & Empowerment Community Connection Appendix
We also help amplify the impact of U.S. employee
donations, matching funds donated to certain
nonprofits by U.S. employees up to $5,000
($10,000 for a Vice President or above, or a Board
member). In 2023, we matched nearly $816,000
in employee donations and, since 2015, have
matched over $5.3 million through this offering.
Philanthropic Investments
Food and Supplies Donation
Throughout 2023, we made food and supply
donations to help communities meet their
basic needs.
Examples of Our Impact Across the Globe
Asia: Employees and Restaurant Staff across
11 countries in Asia participated in Community
Month, with volunteers taking part in various
activities and food donation events to support
under-resourced children and families. For
example, in the Philippines, over 460 employees
participated in 27 “Good Trip” volunteer events,
distributing over 3,000 meals to community
members in need.
Latin America and the Caribbean: To
commemorate Global Volunteer Month, over 975
team members from Arcos Dorados (the largest
McDonald’s Developmental Licensee, with
operations in Latin America and the Caribbean)
participated in numerous volunteer activities,
including beach cleanups, food preparation
and delivery, youth training and tree planting
activities to help make a difference in their
local communities.
The U.S.: McDonald’s USA and its suppliers in the
U.S. donated over 1.5 million pounds of food and
paper combined from suppliers and distribution
centers – worth more than $4.6 million – to
support local U.S. food banks and communities.
Youth Opportunity Program
GOAL
By the end of 2025, reduce barriers
to employment for 2 million young
people.
PROGRESS Achieved early
As of December 2023, we have
achieved our Youth Opportunity
goal ahead of our target year. To
date, 2.2 million young people have
participated in training programs
and/or been hired in McDonald's
Company-owned and operated or
participating Franchisee restaurants.1
We recognize many populations face barriers to
employment around the world, including but not
limited to youth, refugees, senior citizens and
people with disabilities. As we look to the future,
we will assess potential new opportunities to
build on the opportunity employment progress
we have made so far.
Examples of the Company’s and Its Franchisees’
Opportunity Employment Impact Across the Globe
Youth: In the U.S., McDonald’s has partnered
with the International Youth Foundation (IYF)
and nine local community-based organizations
to deliver life skills training called Passport to
Success to young people from households
with incomes at 200% of the federal poverty
line or less.
Refugees and displaced populations:
McDonald’s hires and trains refugees in multiple
markets and is actively exploring how to expand
these initiatives. In 2023, we joined the Tent
Partnership for Refugees – a global network
of over 400 companies committed to helping
refugees connect to jobs – to further accelerate
our refugee inclusion efforts.
Senior citizens: McDonald’s Korea currently
employs approximately 650 senior crew
members (aged 55 and over), an increase of over
34% versus 2022. This market actively recruits
seniors as part of its open recruitment policy
and, in 2023, signed an agreement with Seoul
Metropolitan Government’s 50 Plus Foundation
to create employment opportunities for those
aged 40 and over.
A McDonald’s Franchisee in Taiwan has been
advocating for “Intergenerational Integration” at
work and provides an inclusive work environment
for senior citizens, as well as new immigrants and
homemakers. From 2020 to 2023, there has been
a 59.8% increase in older employees. The market
has been recognized by the Labor Department
for its dedication to promoting senior citizen
employment.
People with disabilities: A McDonald’s
Franchisee in Guatemala, El Salvador,
Honduras and Nicaragua provides employment
opportunities to people with disabilities
through its Labor Integration, “Programa de
Destinate Habilidades.”
In collaboration with external organizations,
a McDonald’s Franchisee in Pakistan created
the “I’m Perfect program” to provide workforce
opportunities to individuals with disabilities,
primarily including individuals with hearing and
speech impairments.

Volunteerism
Volunteering is one of the most significant
ways employees in the McDonald’s System can
support the charities that they care about.
The Company’s Global Volunteer Month was
held in September 2023 and served as an
opportunity for McDonald’s System employees
to support meaningful causes. During the
month, over 12,000 McDonald’s System
employees volunteered more than 28,000 hours
to community causes in over 30 countries. This
represented a more than 60% increase in hours
and a more than 40% increase in volunteers
compared to 2022.
Examples of Our Global Volunteer Month Impact
Across the Globe
Azerbaijan: 40 McDonald’s Azerbaijan
employees volunteered to clean up garbage
from the Caspian coast.
Canada: Employees in McDonald’s Canada
showed community support by volunteering
more than 200 hours with various causes across
the country. In Burnaby and Toronto, volunteers
prepared on-the-go wellness kits and greeting
cards and bagged lunches for families being
supported by a Ronald McDonald House or
Ronald McDonald Family Room; in Toronto,
they also planted trees, shrubs and wildflowers.
In Dorval, volunteers supported the largest
food bank in Canada, Moisson Montréal, while
in Victoria, B.C., volunteers prepared meals
for people at Jenecee Place near the Victoria
General Hospital.
China: McDonald’s China employees organized
various philanthropic activities. In Shanghai,
Beijing and Hunan, employee volunteers and
their children visited Ronald McDonald House
programs to engage in crafts and play with
children. In several cities, including Beijing and
Guangzhou, employees ran “Charity Bazaars,”
raising over RMB 50,000 for the China Soong
Ching Ling Foundation to support Ronald
McDonald House programs. Other regions,
such as Fujian and Zhejiang, partnered with
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to
deliver meals to front-line workers, provide
internships for disabled teens and organize city
tours for disabled children.
Families and Their Well-Being
Supporting Ronald McDonald House Charities
Included in our Community Impact &
Philanthropy strategy is McDonald’s continued
support for Ronald McDonald House Charities
(RMHC).
In 2023, we donated $20 million to RMHC as
part of our five-year, $100 million commitment.
The gift is helping RMHC through direct
financial support that will be used for RMHC
Chapter capacity building, initiative activation
and resource development. We make it easy
for McDonald’s customers to support RMHC,
too, through various on-site and digital giving
opportunities. In some locations, McDonald’s
restaurants donate a percentage from the sale of
specific products to local RMHC Chapters or run
other special promotions benefiting RMHC and
its network of local Chapters.

EEO-1 Component 1 Data
In the U.S., the EEO-1 Component 1 report is a
mandatory annual data collection that requires
all private sector employers with 100 or more
employees to submit demographic workforce
data, including data by race/ethnicity, gender
and job categories. While not required, in
alignment with our journey of accountability and
transparency, McDonald’s has chosen to publicly
share its Consolidated EEO-1 Component 1 Data.
Though the EEO-1 Component 1 is designed to
facilitate uniform reporting for U.S. employers
regardless of differences among their size,
complexity or nature of business, this uniform
approach means that the categories prescribed
in the EEO-1 Component 1 reporting template
do not fully reflect the McDonald’s business
model. For example, the job categories on the
Consolidated EEO-1 Component 1 can be wide
ranging and do not necessarily reflect how
McDonald’s thinks about job categories.

In 2021, we committed to adapting the Company’s climate target to help keep global temperature rises below 1.5°C and reach net zero emissions by 2050.
We have worked to evolve McDonald’s 2030 targets in alignment with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)-approved net zero target. This process included updating the restaurants and offices
target, as well as the supply chain target, based on the latest science and guidance from external experts.

Gross Scope 2 Emissions: 224,964 (2023) market-based
Gross Scope 3 Emissions: 59,929,320 (2023)
As of the end of 2023, restaurant energy use represented 78% of SBTi boundary restaurant and offices emissions footprint, and as such, is a key focus area for accelerating progress against our 2030 targets.
Since 2019, McDonald’s has signed multiple renewable energy projects through Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (VPPAs) and continues to be among other leading corporate renewable energy buyers in adding
new, large-scale renewable energy to the U.S. grid. Our renewable energy projects cover both solar and wind technologies, and are planned to be located in Texas, Illinois, Oklahoma and Louisiana.
Related Goals
By the end of 2030, from a 2018 base year, McDonald’s commits to reduce:
• Absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50.4% from Company-owned and operated restaurants and offices.
• Absolute Scope 3 energy and industrial GHG emissions by 50.4% from Franchisee and Company-owned and operated restaurants, and the facility, logistics and plastic packaging emissions in our supply chain.
• Absolute Scope 3 Forests, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) GHG emissions by 16% and to maintain no deforestation across its primary deforestation-linked commodities.
Our global science-based target, which we revised in 2023, has been validated by the SBTi and covers all three emission scopes in line with a 1.5˚C warming scenario.

Quantitative Percentage (%) FB-RN-250a.1 Commentary
McDonald’s has developed and implemented science- and risk-based food safety and quality standards through collaboration with internal and external experts. These standards include the McDonald’s
Global Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), Supplier Quality Management System (SQMS) and the Distributor Quality Management Process (DQMP). Our McDonald’s Global Food Safety Advisory Council includes
food safety, public health and medical professionals and leaders from North America, Europe and Asia.
This Council meets with our Chief Supply Chain Officer and Global Food Safety team members annually to discuss progress and to provide recommendations to further advance our food safety practices
and standards.
Restaurant food safety and quality management procedures are integrated into the McDonald’s Operations and Training Program, which is based on our Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point
principles and are followed in every restaurant.
In 2023, we added global key performance indicators (KPIs) on required audit completeness and food safety risk mitigation plans and launched an initiative to collect food-related product withdrawal
data globally.
Third-party audits verify that these standards are implemented. In 2023, more than 60,000 restaurant food safety audits (announced and unannounced) were performed. To ensure audits are robust, we
host calibration sessions with our approved third-party auditing firms.

employees
Quantitative Rate FB-RN-310a.1 Commentary
In order to attract and retain talent at all levels of the business, we provide competitive compensation commensurate with a Company employee’s position. We evaluate competitive wage data and
market trends to determine appropriate wage ranges, and ensure compliance with all applicable wage and hour laws.
Well-Being – In 2022, McDonald's added a Global Well-Being Committee to further evolve and focus on the well-being of employees at McDonald's.
We introduced our Global Pay Principles to our owned markets in 2019, to ensure that good pay practices are understood and consistently implemented for all Company employees.
• Competitive – Pay opportunities are aligned with the external value of a job to attract, engage and motivate talent. The competitiveness of our pay rates is reviewed regularly relative to peer companies that
reflect our size, scale, performance and talent needs.
• Non-discriminatory – Company employees are compensated at a level commensurate with their role, responsibility, impact, location, experience, knowledge, skills and performance, irrespective of
gender, race, ethnicity or any other similar protected personal characteristics. See also our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion web page.
• Performance-based – Pay is focused on motivating high performance, recognizing achievement and reinforcing behaviors that align with our culture.
• Understandable – Pay programs are communicated regularly and transparently. We strive for simplicity and focus on the design of our programs to ensure Company employees understand what
determines their pay.
• Compliant – We comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements and standards.
During 2023, we designed and proposed a third-party wage advisory service to be piloted with a group of U.S.-based Franchisees beginning in early 2024. The optional wage advisory service is a Company
investment designed to provide U.S.-based Franchisees with resources and education to help them make third-party-supported wage and compensation decisions for their own businesses based on
benchmarking of locally available data.

(2) As of the end of 2023, more than 96% of pork purchased in the U.S. comes from suppliers that have phased out the use of gestation stalls for housing confirmed pregnant sows.
Commentary
We believe we have a responsibility to improve the health and welfare of animals in our supply chain and work with our global network of suppliers to encourage industry and cross-sector collaboration.
This is why we have animal health and welfare policies or commitments in place across our chicken, eggs, pork, beef and dairy supply chains.
We also believe that reducing any overdependence on antibiotics within our supply chain complements our decades-long commitment to managing and improving the health and welfare of animals. We
are committed to a responsible antibiotic use approach – refining antibiotic selection and administration, reducing non-therapeutic antibiotic use and, when possible, replacing antibiotics with long-term
solutions to prevent diseases and protect animal health and welfare.
Related Goals
In the U.S., we’re working with pork suppliers to phase out the use of gestation stalls for housing pregnant sows by the end of 2024.

Discussion
and Analysis
N/A FB-RN-430a.3 In 2017, McDonald’s announced a global commitment to source chickens raised with improved welfare outcomes. To achieve this, we outlined eight Broiler Welfare Commitments in key markets.12
By the end of 2027, we aim to eliminate the use of antibiotics defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as Highest Priority Critically Important Antibiotics (HPCIAs) to human medicine from all
chicken served in the U.S., Europe, Brazil, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia and China. Across the in-scope markets, HPCIA use has been eliminated in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Japan, South
Korea and the U.S., with China expected to comply before the end of 2027.
In 2018, we implemented McDonald’s Antibiotic Policy for our Beef Supply Chain. It is informed by our VAS and follows global guidance from expert bodies like the WHO and the World Organisation for
Animal Health (WOAH). This policy identifies McDonald’s expectations and anticipated implementation plans with respect to antibiotic use in our beef supply chain while complying with local laws and
regulations. It focuses on the following beef sourcing countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, Poland, the U.K. and the U.S.
We aim to deliver responsible sourcing programs that drive lasting, meaningful outcomes on critical environmental, social and corporate issues. To enable these outcomes, we focus on the following
Priority Impact Areas: promoting the health and welfare of animals; respecting human rights; addressing climate change; reducing food and packaging waste; and protecting nature, forests and
water resources.
McDonald’s works with its suppliers to embed sustainability commitment into global sourcing decisions for food and packaging through Global Sustainable Sourcing Specifications and direct
collaboration on sustainable initiatives.

SASB Index Notes
1 Packaging. Scope: Inclusive of all markets for our fiber-based packaging
and Happy Meal book and toy packaging. For our plastic-based packaging,
all markets are included except for Israel, Latin America and Turkey.
Renewable sources refers to material that is composed of biomass from a
living source and that can be continually replenished. Renewable applies to
plastics only, not fiber. Source: ISO 14021:2016 for plastic, ASTM 6866 or ISO
16620-2. Fiber-based packaging made from 100% recycled sources must
be third-party verified, unless certified under a Chain of Custody Forest
Management standard. McDonald’s requires all wood fiber sourced from
Argentina, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Russia and Vietnam
to be Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®) certified or FSC® controlled wood
sources with full chain of custody certification. Perfluorinated compounds are
known to be historically persistent in the environment. McDonald’s commits
to not intentionally adding fluorinated compounds through our processes,
but fluorinated compounds present in the local environment make it difficult
to remove all traces of fluorine from packaging. Please refer to our Nature,
Forests & Water web page for additional definitions. Exclusions: Primary fiber-
based packaging in food packaged off-site of McDonald’s restaurants, tray
liners and limited locally sourced items.
2 Non-structural components of packaging vary based on the packaging but
may include adhesives, inks, overprint varnishes, retention agents or binders,
processing aids, impact modifiers, minerals used non-structurally and
nucleating and clarifying agents. We continue to monitor industry standards
on these components and opportunities to work toward making any part of our
packaging, including non-structural components, more sustainable.
3 Toys. Scope: Inclusive of all toys. Fiber-based toys or fiber components in the
toys: 100% certified fiber required. All other materials: McDonald’s ambition
is to reduce the use of virgin fossil fuel-based plastics, offer more sustainable
toys by the end of 2025 and not manufacture electronics and batteries in
Happy Meal toys globally. For bio- and plant-based plastics to be considered
sustainable for McDonald’s, a minimum of 60% of plastic weight is required to
come from recycled or renewable content or a combination of recycled and
renewable content, though in many practical applications we anticipate that
percentage will be much higher. The remaining 40% may be conventional
fossil fuel-based material. These thresholds were developed in conjunction
with input from NGOs, external manufacturing partners and scientists, and
based on an assessment of sustainable toy and packaging industry leaders
so that our targets reflected current sustainable engineering capabilities to
maintain safety and functionality. Our efforts will result in an approximate
90% reduction in virgin fossil fuel-based plastic use against a 2018 baseline.
Fiber-based packaging made from 100% recycled sources must be third-
party verified, unless certified under a Chain of Custody Forest Management
standard. Source: ISO 14021:2016. McDonald’s requires all wood fiber sourced
from Argentina, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Russia and
Vietnam to be Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®) certified or FSC® controlled
wood sources with full chain of custody certification. The thresholds described
above do not include the presence of adhesives, glues, inks, paints and
coatings.
4 Markets with advanced infrastructure: Mature waste and recycling
infrastructure at a national level that has (1) recycling infrastructure network
across the entire market, (2) multiple materials being recycled within this
national infrastructure network, (3) existing legislation on recycling and (4) high
customer awareness of waste and recycling. At the end of 2023, that included
21 markets where McDonald’s operates.
5 Fluorinated Compounds. Scope: Inclusive of all markets except for Israel,
Latin America and Turkey, and Happy Meal book and toy packaging. Renewable
sources refers to material that is composed of biomass from a living source
and that can be continually replenished. Renewable applies to plastics only, not
fiber. Source: ISO 14021:2016 for plastic, ASTM 6866 or ISO 16620-2. Fiber-based
packaging made from 100% recycled sources must be third-party verified,
unless certified under a Chain of Custody Forest Management standard.
McDonald’s requires all wood fiber sourced from Argentina, Cambodia, China,

fluorine from packaging. Please refer to our Nature, Forests & Water web page
for additional definitions. Exclusions: Primary fiber-based packaging in food
packaged off-site of McDonald’s restaurants, tray liners and limited locally
sourced items.
6 Beef. Scope: Includes all beef raw material used in beef patties sourced for
McDonald’s products from beef patty manufacturers that supply McDonald’s
restaurants in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Germany, Ireland, France, New
Zealand, Canada, the U.K. or Poland. Includes all McDonald’s restaurants
owned and operated by the Company and its Franchisees in these countries,
which collectively represent over 80% of our global beef volumes, as of the
end of 2021. The Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB) aims to
define the principles of and criteria for beef sustainability globally. The five
core principles are focused on the following: managing natural resources
responsibly; respecting people and communities; caring for the welfare of
animals; ensuring the safety and quality of beef; and driving efficiency and
innovation to reduce waste and improve economic viability. These principles
allow for national and regional interpretation, given the significant variation in
production systems, legal frameworks, sociopolitical factors and climates that
exist across the globe. Exclusions: Beef used as secondary ingredients.
7 Fish: Fish refers to any type of fish species used as an ingredient in a
McDonald’s product and listed on the product’s ingredient statement. Wild-
Caught Fish refers to fish that come from seas, rivers and other natural
bodies of water. Filet-O-Fish sandwich refers to the McDonald’s menu item
containing wild-caught fish. Verified sustainable sources refers to wild-
caught fish, sourced by suppliers to the McDonald’s System, from fisheries that
are annually verified as compliant with the McDonald’s Sustainable Fisheries
Standard by the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership. MSC Certification is
optional to McDonald’s markets. Fisheries may also be independently certified
as meeting the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) Principles and Criteria for
Sustainable Fishing where a certificate of conformity to an MSC Standard
has been granted. Source: www.msc.org. McDonald’s may display the MSC
certification logo in some of its markets where fisheries and restaurants are
certified against the MSC Chain of Custody traceability standard. Scope:
Includes all wild-caught fish sourced for Filet-O-Fish sandwich portions served
in McDonald’s restaurants. Filet-O-Fish sandwich represents over 97% of
the total fish volumes used in the McDonald’s System (by weight). Includes
all suppliers of wild-caught fish for Filet-O-Fish sandwich to the McDonald’s
System and all McDonald’s restaurants owned and operated by the Company
and its Franchisees that sell fish. Exclusions: Products that are not Filet-O-Fish
sandwich containing wild-caught or farmed fish. We estimate that these
products represent less than 2% of the total fish sourced by McDonald’s by
weight and may include products such as tuna, prawns, shrimp, salmon and
calamari; other breaded products; and locally sourced products. The Company
has set an expectation that these products are sustainably sourced, although
they are not included in this global performance measure given the local, and
often promotional, nature of these items. Moving forward, we have plans in
place to reduce sourcing from non-compliant fisheries and will increase our
supply of fish sourced from compliant fisheries as new facility options become
available.

operated by the Company and its Franchisees that use palm oil. All countries
are currently identified as high-deforestation priority regions for palm oil and
all volumes are required to be covered by Roundtable on Sustainable Palm
Oil (RSPO) certification or credits. All RSPO supply chain models applicable
to RSPO are applicable to McDonald’s ‒ RSPO Identity Preserved (IP), RSPO
Segregated (SG), RSPO Mass Balance (MB) and Book and Claim (BC) ‒ although
McDonald’s is committed to increasing traceability by specifying physical
certification for the palm oil used in the McDonald’s System in the greatest
volumes (IP, SG or MB). Exclusions: Palm oil, palm kernel oil or their derivative
used as secondary ingredients in McDonald’s products. This is when palm oil is
used as an ingredient within an ingredient, for example, an emulsifier.
9 Soy (for chicken feed). Scope: Includes all soybean volume used in the feed
of chicken sourced for McDonald’s products by all chicken suppliers to the
McDonald’s System and all McDonald’s restaurants owned and operated by
the Company and its Franchisees that sell chicken. Europe refers to Austria,
Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,
Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia,
Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Moldova, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland,
Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
the U.K. and Ukraine. Countries with regions currently identified as high-
deforestation priority regions for soy include Argentina (Chaco biome),
Brazil (Amazon and Cerrado biomes) and Paraguay (Chaco biome). Given the
complexity of soy supply chains, we consider that, unless demonstrated, all of
McDonald’s sources of soy for chicken feed fall into high-deforestation priority
regions, with the exception of chicken sourced in North America, where soy
used in chicken feed is locally produced and considered low risk. Exclusions:
Soy used as an ingredient in McDonald’s products sold in restaurants, for
example, soy oil.
10 Coffee. Scope: Includes all ground and whole bean coffee, including
decaffeinated coffee, used in espresso-based drinks and coffee brewed at
McDonald’s restaurants, and all ground and whole bean coffee in McDonald’s-
branded retail products. Includes all suppliers of coffee to the McDonald’s
System. Market scope includes all McDonald’s restaurants owned and
operated by the Company and its Franchisees that sell coffee, and retail
outlets selling McDonald’s-branded coffee products. Countries with regions
currently identified as high-deforestation priority regions for coffee include
Honduras, Indonesia and Vietnam. McDonald’s requires all coffee sourced from
these regions to be Rainforest Alliance Certified. Exclusions: Coffee extracts
and ingredients used in products such as frappés and coffee in baked goods;
coffee in cold brew drinks if they are brewed off-site; coffee extract in ready-to-
drink retail products; and other locally sourced products containing coffee.
11 Fiber. Scope: Primary fiber-based packaging refers to products that are used
to package guest food on premises at McDonald’s restaurants. This type of
packaging includes containers, cups, wraps, bags for food, beverages, napkins,
folding cartons, clamshells, food service bags, napkins, salad bowls, Happy
Meal cartons, drink carriers and cup carriers. Includes all suppliers of primary-
based packaging to the McDonald’s System and all McDonald’s restaurants
owned and operated by the Company and its Franchisees. In 2021, the primary
fiber-based packaging scope was expanded to include plastic alternatives
such as wood stirrers and cutlery, and paper straws and lids. This broadened
scope has resulted in a slight decrease in percent compliance. All volumes of
contingency items sourced from suppliers compliant with our standards but
not integrated into our data reporting system were counted as non-compliant.
Countries with regions currently identified as high-deforestation priority
regions for fiber include Argentina, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Russia and Vietnam. McDonald’s requires all wood fiber sourced from these
regions to be Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®) certified or FSC® controlled
wood sources with full chain of custody certification. Exclusions: Primary
fiber-based packaging in food packaged off-site McDonald’s restaurants; tray
liners, straws and limited locally sourced items.
12 Broiler welfare: These commitments apply to chickens raised for sale at
McDonald’s restaurants in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland,
the Netherlands, Poland, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, the U.K. and the U.S.
Russia has been removed from the scope of this goal based on our 2022 exit
from this market.
13 Franchisees are independent employers and select which of their employees
attend Hamburger University.
