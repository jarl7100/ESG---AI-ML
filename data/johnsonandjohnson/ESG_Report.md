ESG strategy
J&J integrates ESG into our business strategies, starting at the highest levels of leadership, where the Board has overall accountability for ESG risk management oversight. Our ESG strategy informs our approach to delivering positive impact for our stakeholders while managing ESG-related risks and opportunities.
 Our ESG strategy is grounded in Our Credo values, informed by both our Company’s purpose to profoundly impact health for humanity and the views of our external stakeholders. The strategy focuses our efforts on the areas where we are well positioned to achieve the greatest impact: innovation and advancing health for all, empowering our employees and advancing environmental health. Leading with accountability is foundational to these efforts.
OurESGapproachisdesignedtoeffectivelygovernandmanagerisks, including ESG risks, while enabling us to identify opportunities that accurately reflect our business strategy.
The Enterprise Compliance & Risk Committee (ECRC), chaired by our Chief Technical Operations & Risk Officer with representatives from our business segments and enterprise risk functions, provides governance and oversight for the management of current and emerging risks and facilitation of action planning across the Company, including ESG related matters.
For more information on how we are managing ESG risks and embedding sustainability into decision-making, please see our
Position on ESG Governance .
Stakeholder engagement
J&J interacts with numerous stakeholders at the global, national and local levels to understand their expectations of us and gain valuable insight into what matters to them, so that we can better respond to their needs. Our key stakeholders include:
• PatientsareatthecenterofallwedoatJ&J.Weprioritizesafety, innovation and accessibility to deliver best-in-class solutions for patients at every step of their health journey.
• Healthcare providers—including physicians, nurses and a range of health workers—are critical to ensuring patients receive the professional, timely and holistic care they need.
• Our employees are critical to our continued success. We foster
a culture built on Our Credo values where merit is rewarded and employees are encouraged to grow both professionally and personally.
• Investors play a vital role in providing capital for J&J to grow
and deliver on our ambitious plans to address the world's toughest healthcare challenges while delivering value to shareholders.
Examples of how we engaged these, and other stakeholder groups, in 2024 can be found throughout our 2024 Health for Humanity Report. For a full list of stakeholder groups, see our
