A NOTE ON OUR BUSINESS We don’t “boycott.” A NOTE ON OUR TARGETS
JPMorgan Chase & Co. provides fnancial services for individuals
and industries across geographies — regardless of political, social
or religious viewpoints. We deal in facts and don’t describe our
policies, procedures or progress diferently based on who’s asking.
Our ambition is to work with shareholders, clients, customers and
communities around the world to fulfll banking’s essential purpose
of helping people, businesses of all sizes and vital institutions —
like schools, hospitals and governments — achieve their goals.
We support clients around the globe and in every state in the
U.S., across industries, religions and political afliation. We
proudly serve more than 82 million consumer customers in the
U.S., 6.4 million small businesses and hundreds of thousands of
companies in critical economic sectors. We do not make decisions
based on political or social agendas.
Markets and economies of all sizes beneft when free and
fair enterprise thrives — creating innovation, competition
and maximizing value for shareholders, clients, customers
and communities. Government intervention of free market
principles, or attempting to use businesses to advance a
political or social agenda sets a dangerous precedent.
We set targets to do our part in seeking a sustainable and
inclusive future using our own independent assessment of
what we determine is reasonable, achievable and will serve
the best interest of our business and serving our clients.
While we pursue these targets, we note that they are
subject to other prerequisites and critical considerations,
both within and outside our control. These include the
necessity of technological advancements; data quality and
availability; the evolution of consumer behavior and
demand; the business decisions of our clients, who are
responsive to their own stakeholders; the need for
thoughtful public policies; the potential impact of legal and
regulatory obligations; market conditions; and the challenge
of balancing short-term targets with the need to facilitate
an orderly transition and energy security.
We manage risk. We value engagement.
Managing risk is critical to the long-term success of our business
and required by our regulators. We make risk-based assessments,
including legal, credit, market, reputational and regulatory, to
drive decisions and advance the interests of our constituencies.
We believe the best answers reside in engagement and
discourse. When policymakers seek input to tackle
challenges, we want to help. We know that our success
requires working closely with government and stakeholders
on sound public policy that grows the economy and lifts up
communities. Throughout our history, we have engaged with
ofcials from all parties to address the world’s most
pressing needs, and we look forward to continuing to do so.
We make independent business decisions for the Firm.
We make business decisions to advance the long-term interests
of our Firm and its shareholders, including serving our clients,
supporting our employees and helping our communities. We work
with a broad array of organizations that advance those interests,
even if we don’t support every position taken. Firm decisions are
always made independently and based on business principles.
We want to compete.
Our ability to compete, in both established and new markets, is
critical to the long-term success of our business. We decide where
and how we choose to compete by assessing risk and opportunity,
not to further political or social agendas.

APPENDICES
At JPMorgan Chase, we know that maintaining a healthy
and vibrant company that takes care of employees,
customers and communities helps build shareholder value.
The prior year’s events, including infation rates, volatile
markets and growing political tensions, have
demonstrated that our fortress balance sheet and our
dedication to excellence in operations and service helped
our clients and customers navigate a range of economic
and geopolitical challenges. In good and tough times, we
remain committed to helping make opportunities happen
and foster sustainable, inclusive economic growth —
which is good for those we serve.
In this ESG Report, we explain how we harness business
opportunities and mitigate risks, as well as highlight our
ongoing eforts to do our part to support the energy
transition and sustainable development. We believe our
actions help us to continue to earn stakeholders’ trust
and their business.
The report highlights the progress toward our Sustainable
Development Target, which includes actions that support
our Green, Development Finance and Community
Development objectives. We believe that economic growth,
energy security and sustainability are interconnected. In
2023, amidst ongoing global uncertainty, we continued to
support energy security and the ongoing transition to
low-carbon energy sources. In 2023, we expanded our Oil
and Gas End Use target to an Energy Mix target to refect
how our fnancing supports the energy transition and
presents a more comprehensive view of the
decarbonization eforts of our clients. We also updated
our Auto Manufacturing, Electric Power and Oil & Gas
Operational emissions intensity reduction targets to align
with net zero by 2050 and added two sectors — Shipping
and Aluminum. We also continued eforts to minimize our
environmental impacts across our corporate ofces, data
centers and branch network.
We remain committed to advancing sustainable
community development. For example, while we have
served Detroit for more than 90 years, our $200 million
investment in the city’s economic recovery during the
prior decade underscores that sustained community
investment is a smart business strategy. Looking back, we
see the returns in the strength of our customers and
communities — in their abilities to access opportunity,
plan for the future and pursue their dreams. Since making
our initial commitment in 2014, our market share in
Detroit has increased, Chase consumer and small
business accounts and balances have risen, and mortgage
originations have improved. The city is an incubator of
ideas, which we’ve learned from and taken to several
other communities to drive lasting change. We do this
work because we know healthy communities are
important to our business success.
Finally, we are focused on doing what's right for our
business and our people. I’m most proud of our more
than 309,000 employees who continue to act with
integrity and purpose that drives impact and connects
those we serve with products and services that help them
achieve their goals. We continue to invest to attract and
retain a talented, diverse workforce that will support our
Firm’s eforts into the future.
Please read this year’s ESG Report to learn more about
how we bring our expertise, capital, data and resources
to meaningfully contribute to the markets we operate in
and drive shareholder value.

Our Approach to ESG
At JPMorgan Chase, we aim to support inclusive, sustainable economic growth because we believe our business
thrives when all the communities we serve do the same. The fnance sector can help to address some of the
most pressing environmental and social (“E&S”) challenges of our time, primarily by running a healthy and
vibrant company; supporting its clients, customers and employees; and providing targeted capital to help scale
solutions. With our Purpose and Business Principles in mind, we are leveraging our expertise, capital, data and
resources to advance inclusive growth, promote sustainable development, and support the transition to a
low-carbon economy. Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") matters are an important consideration in
how we do business, including how we develop our products and services, serve our customers, support our
employees and help lift our communities.
Our approach to ESG is supported and strengthened by our ongoing eforts to enhance accountability,
transparency and engagement. Additionally, we strive to leverage the Firm’s governance structures to foster
sound management and a culture of accountability on ESG matters. This includes defning oversight and
management of ESG matters within and across our lines of business.

Development Target

APPENDICES
We believe creating sustainable economic growth is important to the long-term strength and vibrancy of the global
economy, as well as to the prosperity and well-being of people and communities around the world.
In 2021, we established our Sustainable Development Target (“SDT”) with a clear purpose: to help catalyze global
sustainable economic growth. To us, this means using our capital and expertise to support our clients and
customers and help accelerate the global transition to a low-carbon economy, while also contributing to
socioeconomic development and inclusive growth. Our goal is to fnance and facilitate more than $2.5 trillion over 10
years — from 2021 through the end of 2030 — to help advance long-term climate solutions and contribute to
sustainable development. Our end-of-2030 goal corresponds with the timeframe we set to meet our net zero-
aligned targets for our fnanced emissions (see pages 30–31), as well as the timeframe set by the United Nations for
achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”).
Our SDT refects the Firm’s global, diversifed franchise — incorporating activity across both our retail and wholesale
banking segments — and aims to grow and strengthen our business activities across three important objectives:
Green, Development Finance and Community Development.
Business activities that qualify toward the SDT include transactions in which the Firm is raising capital and/or
extending credit, those for which we are providing advisory, risk management and other facilitation services, and
principal capital investments made for commercial purposes2
.
We developed the SDT's criteria and methodology taking into account international market practices and industry
standards, such as the SDGs, the International Capital Market Association’s Green and Social Bond Principles, and
the International Finance Corporation’s Anticipated Impact Measurement and Monitoring system. We aim to be
transparent in our methodology and may recalibrate our approach over time.
For more information about our criteria for determining which business activity is eligible to count toward our
Sustainable Development Target and how we account for the value of transactions, see Our Approach to Our
Sustainable Development Target.
Aiming to support climate action, clean energy, and sustainable resource management, with a focus on accelerating
the deployment of solutions for cleaner sources of energy and facilitating the transition to a low-carbon economy.
We are targeting $1 trillion toward this objective by the end of 2030.
Working to support sustainable development in emerging economies, with a focus on mobilizing capital to advance
the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
Community Development
Striving to advance economic inclusion in developed markets, with a focus in the United States on Low-to-Moderate
Income individuals and communities and closing the racial wealth gap among Black, Hispanic and Latino individuals
and communities. This includes many of the actions we are taking as part of our Racial Equity Commitment.
2 Activities that we count toward our SDT and that meet the eligibility criteria detailed in our Sustainable Bond Framework may also be included in our Sustainable Asset Portfolio, to which net proceeds from our Sustainable Bond issuances are allocated. For more information on
JPMorgan Chase’s Sustainable Bond issuances, see page 84.

We track progress toward our SDT by attributing business activity across the Firm
that supports our SDT’s objectives.
Progress toward our SDT, like our other ESG-related initiatives, is subject to certain
prerequisites both within and outside our control. These include market conditions,
public policy and technological advancement, among others. Our fnancing and
advisory initiatives are also subject to the same macroeconomic conditions that
impact our franchise and the broader fnancial markets.

In 2023, we fnanced and facilitated approximately $194 b illion toward the SDT:
$66 billion toward the Green objective, $102 b illion toward the Development Finance
objective and $26 billion toward the Community Development objective. Collectively,
since 2021, we have fnanced and facilitated $675 billion toward our SDT, including
$242 billion toward our $1 trillion Green objective.
Despite a complex global macroeconomic environment during 2023, we continued to
make progress toward our SDT and to support our clients. However, challenging mar-
ket conditions, including rising interest rates and a decline in global investment bank-
ing activities , contributed to slower progress compared to 2022. 4
Our progress toward our SDT will continue to be infuenced by market conditions,
public policy, and technological advancement, and as such, we do not expect our
progress to be linear. In line with the Firm’s approach for the rest of our business,
we do not manage the SDT focused on short-term results, but rather, focused on
positioning ourselves to drive long-term progress. At JPMorgan C hase, we are
focused on supporting our clients through the cycle — including in their sustainable
development ambitions — and we will continue to play our part to help advance
sustainable development. In this section, we report our progress in each objective
through December 31, 2023.

3 Reported progress toward the SDT for the year 2023 refects of updates to Our Approach to Our Sustainable Development Target published April 2024. Updates to our Our Approach and determinations regarding
eligibility and categorization of transactions into diferent criteria, are overseen by an internal governance group.
4 Global investment banking activities (i.e., M&A, equities, bonds and loans) were down in 2023 by 10% compared to the previous year according to Dealogic.
5 On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (“FRB”) from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as receiver. As of December 31, 2023, reported
progress toward our SDT and/or any of its objectives does not include transactions executed by FRB prior to acquisition. Post-acquisition, transactions executed by JPMorgan Chase are counted toward our SDT.
6 On January 25, 2024, JPMorgan Chase announced new responsibilities for several key executives. As a result of these organizational changes, the Firm will be reorganizing its business segments to refect the manner in
which the segments will be managed. The reorganization of the business segments is expected to be efective in the second quarter of 2024.
The three objectives of our SDT — Green, Development
Finance and Community Development — refect our belief
that creating sustainable economic growth requires
advancing environmental, economic and social goals. When
tracking transactions that support multiple objectives of our
SDT, we count transactions only once and toward only one
objective in the following order (as applicable): Green,
Development Finance or Community Development. With this
approach, we seek to avoid double counting, simplify
tracking toward our progress, and create clarity in our
disclosures.
We disclose more information on some of these key areas in
the following sections, such as how we track and count sus-
tainability bonds, and certain J.P. Morgan Development
Finance Institution (“JPM DFI”) and Community Development
activities toward our Green objective. We also highlight case
studies that overlap across two objectives of our SDT to
underscore the benefts that can be created by simultane-
ously supporting the advancement of environmental and
social issues (see page 13).
When done for commercial purposes and aligned with our
eligibility criteria, we may count our principal capital
investments toward our SDT. We believe our principal capital
can help catalyze the growth and success of companies
developing solutions to help achieve sustainable
development. For example, in 2023, the Firm became an
investor in the United Airlines Ventures Sustainable Flight
Fund, a frst-of-its-kind investment vehicle designed to
support early-stage companies focused on decarbonizing air
travel by accelerating the research, production and
technologies associated with Sustainable Aviation Fuels. This
investment is refected in our reported progress toward the
Green objective for the year 2023.

and forests. These aims can support each other; certain climate solutions, such as reforestation, can also have
positive impacts on nature, biodiversity and the sustainable management of resources. Eligible green activities

Our Approach to ESG
Many of the eligible transactions counted toward our Green objective can be used for multiple eligible activities
(e.g., a green bond where proceeds can be used for both renewable energy and water conservation) and are,
therefore, categorized as “multiple criteria.” We show a breakdown of the types of transactions included in the

In 2023, JPMorgan Chase provided fnancing of $27.6 million to support the Viridi Energy and American
Organic Energy (“AOE”) partnership in the construction of a waste-to-energy facility located in Yaphank,
New York. The AOE facility is projected to convert approximately 210,000 metric tons of food waste per year
into renewable natural gas (“RNG”) and agriculture products and, once completed, it is expected to be one
of the largest facilities of its kind in the U.S. The project also represents a step toward circularity in waste
disposal as it is expected to house the frst anaerobic digester to process food waste in the New York City
metropolitan area. It also aligns with the food loss and waste reduction domestic goals set by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In addition, the facility is expected to
generate emissions reductions of approximately 100,000 metric tons of CO2e per year and is projected to
produce a volume of RNG equivalent to 10 million gallons of gasoline annually. A 2 0-year oftake agreement
for renewable energy produced at the facility has been signed by a Canadian energy solutions provider.

The Development Finance objective of the SDT highlights the work of the JPM DFI, which works to mobilize
capital toward sustainable development in developing countries. The JPM DFI qualifes CIB transactions with
anticipated environmental and socioeconomic impacts, including eligible markets transactions such as
derivatives (foreign exchange, rates, commodities). The JPM DFI also acts as the development fnance
structuring agent (“DFSA”) for a diverse set of corporate and sovereign transactions, which involves assisting
clients to measure and communicate the development impact of their transaction with investors and other
stakeholders. It also seeks to expand the market for development fnance overall and grow the pool of

Community Development
Our work in the Community Development objective of our SDT supports areas such as homeownership and
afordable housing, small business growth, education and healthcare, with a focus on Low-to-Moderate Income
(“LMI”) individuals and underserved communities, and Black, Hispanic and Latino individuals and communities.
In 2023, we fnanced and facilitated approximately $26 billion toward this objective. This includes $8 b illion in
home ownership, $2 b illion in small business fnancing and $9 b illion for afordable housing.
The Community Development objective includes many of the activities we are engaging in as part of our Racial
Equity Commitment to help close the racial wealth gap and advance economic inclusion among historically
underserved communities in the U.S., including Black, Hispanic and Latino customers and communities — this
includes lending and equity investments to help increase homeownership, expand afordable housing and
support for vital community institutions, and grow small businesses.
Of the $127 billion qualifed to this objective of our SDT since 2021, approximately $28.6 billion counted toward
our Racial Equity Commitment. For more detail on our Racial Equity Commitment, see page 54–59.
CASE STUDY OUR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT TARGET IN ACTION: CONCERN HOUSING8
At JPMorgan Chase, we strive to help provide sustainable and afordable housing for New Yorkers. As part of
these eforts, the Firm supported Concern Housing, a non-proft organization that works across the public
and private sectors to help individuals and families access afordable and sustainable housing. In 2023,
JPMorgan Chase provided an approximately $25 million construction loan to Concern Housing to build
Concern Logan, a 66-unit afordable housing development in Brooklyn, New York. Upon completion, in 2025,
the development is expected to be submitted for certifcation under the Enterprise Green Communities
Criteria (“EGCC”), the comprehensive green building framework developed by Enterprise Community
Partners to design afordable housing that provides cost-efective standards for creating healthy, energy-
efcient and environmentally responsible homes. The housing development aims to provide safe and
consistent housing for adults, including veterans, experiencing homelessness and individuals with psychiatric
disabilities. Concern Housing plans to provide support and resources to residents as they transition out of
homelessness, including job placement services, counseling and medical care.

At JPMorgan, our corporate governance practices are designed to serve the
diverse interests of our stakeholders, including customers, clients,
employees, shareholders and communities we operate in. We frmly believe
that continued success is rooted in our steadfast adherence to our Business
Principles. These principles, which are centered around strengthening,
safeguarding, and growing our company over the long term, are
consistently applied across all LOBs and geographies where we operate. As
we continue to deepen our understanding of ESG matters, we remain
committed to regularly assessing and refning our governance structures,
processes and controls. This commitment allows our governance practices
to remain efective and aligned with the evolving ESG landscape.
Oversight and Management of ESG
Responsibility for oversight and management of ESG occurs at multiple levels
within the organization.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board is responsible for oversight of the business and afairs of the Firm on
behalf of shareholders. It is also responsible for setting the cultural “tone at the
top”. Its core areas of oversight include strategy, executive performance, talent
management and succession planning, fnancial performance and condition,
risk management and internal control framework and on ESG matters.
The Board considers its composition and needs holistically, determining the
diversity of experience, background and perspective required to efectively
oversee the Firm, including its present and future strategy. Brief summaries of
complex and dynamic skills and experience found among our Board members
— which include ESG matters — can be found in our Proxy Statement.
The Board oversees management directly and through its fve standing
committees:
• Public Responsibility Committee
• Compensation & Management Development Committee
• Risk Committee
• Audit Committee
• Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee
Each committee operates pursuant to a written charter and oversees ESG-
related matters within its scope of responsibility. These charters and the Firm’s
Corporate Governance Principles guide the Board’s governance and oversight
functions and can be accessed on our website. Our annual Proxy Statement
includes additional information about the membership and responsibilities of
each committee.
The Board considers ESG-related matters in full Board discussions and com-
mittee discussions, as appropriate. In addition, the director education program
includes ESG issues, as appropriate. In the past year, discussion and education
topics included, among others, ESG-related matters, including sustainability,
the Racial Equity Commitment, climate risk management, and diversity,
equity and inclusion (“DEI”).
SENIOR MANAGEMENT
Our management structure is designed to encourage leadership that is
consistent with our corporate standards. We manage our Firm on a LOB basis
with leaders within each of our LOBs responsible for driving LOB strategy and
execution, including relating to ESG matters where applicable, across the Firm.
Our Firm’s most senior management body is the Operating Committee (“OC”)9
,
which is responsible for developing and implementing corporate strategy and
managing operations. The OC is composed of our Chief Executive Ofcer
(“CEO”), Chief Risk Ofcer (“CRO”), Chief Financial Ofcer (“CFO”), General
Counsel, CEOs of each of the LOBs and other senior executives.
The CRO, the Head of Human Resources, the Global Head of Diversity, Equity
and Inclusion, the Global Head of Corporate Responsibility, the Global Head of
Sustainability and other senior leaders provide periodic updates on ESG
initiatives to the OC and Board of Directors.

build long-lasting relationships based on trust
and mutual respect.
• We engage regularly with our customers in our branches. We seek customer feedback via online and
in-branch surveys, with the aim of improving customer interaction and experience, and have a conduct
hotline through which our customers can anonymously raise concerns and report misconduct, where
permitted by law. We also engage with our clients through one-on-one meetings, roundtables
and conferences.
• We listen and respond to the needs of our customers and clients by ofering certain products and
services that consider social and environmental responsibility, including lending for afordable housing
and electric vehicles and supporting underserved small businesses through fnancial health programs.
• We have approximately 300 community-style branches,
including our 16 Community Centers, that continue to host
community events, fnancial health workshops, skills training
and small business pop-up events. These branches are

Employees • We engage with our employees through surveys, including our global Employee Opinion Survey, which
are conducted periodically, and exit surveys. These surveys allow us to identify areas of strength and
opportunities to promote continued employee satisfaction and retention.
• In 2023, 90% of our employees provided valuable insight by
participating in our Employee Opinion Survey, and we held our
eighth annual Employee Appreciation Week with over 1,500
events across our ofces.

are vital to our success. We work to understand our
employees’ evolving needs and perspectives. • We also engage with our employees through various forums, including town halls; small group meet-
ings; focus groups; blogs, articles and newsletters; online feedback tools; and others.
10 When customers in markets that have a community branch were asked survey questions in Q3 2021 and Q2 2023, they answered more favorably in Q2 2023, compared to results for the same questions and same periods in comparable markets that do not have a community branch.
There was an 8-point improvement for the survey question, “How likely are you to consider [Chase] as a provider the next time you’re in the market for a checking or savings account?” and a 13-point improvement for the survey statement, “Chase is a bank I trust.”

At JPMorgan Chase, our overall objective is to manage our business, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of our clients,
customers and investors with protecting the safety and soundness of the Firm. The world today faces environmental and social challenges, such as climate
change, biodiversity and ecosystem loss, and human rights issues. If not adequately addressed, these challenges could create risks for society and businesses.
An important component of risk management at JPMorgan Chase is assessing our clients’ approach to, and performance on, E&S matters. Failing to appropriately
manage E&S risks can impact our clients’ operations and long-term economic viability, increase scrutiny from our investors, employees, and regulators, and
impact the environment and communities across the world.
We have frameworks in place to identify client business models with high concentrations of E&S risk that have the highest potential reputational impact to our
Firm. These frameworks include restricted activities related to the environment and human rights, including forced labor, harmful child labor, human trafcking
and other types of modern slavery, that fall outside of the Firm’s appetite. The frameworks also include activities and locations we consider sensitive or in need of
enhanced review to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the associated risks. Client and transaction decisions take into consideration these frameworks,
as well as a variety of other client-specifc factors, including, but not limited to, a client’s track record and engagement in resolving the identifed issues.
We continue to invest in E&S subject matter experts that conduct due diligence on clients’ commitment and capacity to manage the risks relevant to their
activities, including the companies’ policies, governance, track record, risk management and stakeholder engagement approaches. We strive to support our
clients and ofer them information and guidance aimed at furthering their environmental and social objectives.
Please see pages 82–83 in our ESG Report Appendices for more information on how we manage E&S risk for certain business activities and locations.

GUIDING E&S PRINCIPLES
Where relevant, we consider a range of internationally recognized
principles to inform our approach in managing certain E&S risks.
These include:
• Equator Principles
• International Finance Corporation Performance Standards,
including Performance Standard 7 on Indigenous Peoples, and
World Bank Environmental, Health & Safety Guidelines
• Relevant International Capital Markets Association / Loan
Market Association principles such as the Green Bond Principles,
Sustainability Linked Loan Principles, Social / Sustainable /

• Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures
• Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures
• UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights
• UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights
We recognize that human rights issues are a signifcant global challenge. We acknowledge that our business has the potential to impact surrounding communities and the environment; as such, it is important that we consider human rights issues
when making business decisions. While national governments bear primary responsibility to protect the human rights of their citizens, including their safety and security, we strive to respect and promote human rights with our employees,
suppliers and clients, as guided by the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We seek to comply with applicable legal requirements in the jurisdictions in which we
operate. It is our policy that we will not knowingly provide fnancial services to clients where we determine that there is substantiated evidence of forced labor, harmful child labor, human trafcking or other types of modern slavery, and where
such client has not put into place adequate practices and policies to remediate such human rights abuses. For more information on how we manage human rights and modern slavery-related risks in our operations, business activities of our

As digital solutions continue to evolve and play a role in fnancial services and the economy as a whole, the risk of cyber-attacks and other threats to information security continues to evolve and grow. In addition, the individuals with whom the
Firm interacts expect that our data practices are safe and lawful. Data privacy and cybersecurity therefore remain top priorities for our Firm.

Data Privacy
As a global fnancial institution, our Firm collects, processes, uses, shares and
dispositions all manner of personal and fnancial information every day, and
we have processes designed to manage that data in accordance with the laws,
rules and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We take a multi-
faceted approach to addressing privacy and data protection risks, including
maintaining and evolving our internal controls, establishing policies covering
all stages of the data lifecycle and deploying appropriate technology.
Our frmwide internal policy on personal information applies globally to our
legal entities, as well as to third parties that handle personal information on
our behalf. The policy sets forth minimum requirements, including that per-
sonal information is processed for defned purposes. The policy also specifes
the use of privacy by design principles, designed to ensure that privacy is
taken into account throughout the data lifecycle.
Data protection and privacy are key components of our global data risk
management program. That program focuses on execution of the compliance
and operational risk oversight of data management and privacy governance,
controls, and remediation activities in the Firm. The Firm’s privacy framework
outlines roles and responsibilities, sets policies and standards, directs advisory
requests, and provides protocols for monitoring, reporting, and escalation of
key privacy risks and issues. Our management, including our OC, and our
Board of Directors receive periodic updates on the program. Our multi-
stakeholder approach to oversight and governance is embedded in our three
lines of defense and supported by dedicated data and privacy teams around
the world. We provide regular training and awareness to our workforce, not
only on core privacy obligations and how to meet them but also on emerging
risks, trends and new developments.
Information on how we collect, process, use, share and disposition personal
information, as well as rights that individuals may have with respect to their
personal information and how to exercise them, is available in our disclosures,
on our websites and upon request through multiple channels. In addition to
traditional privacy notices, we often publish related materials such as frequently
asked questions and tips for keeping personal fnancial information safe.
We have a wide range of technological, administrative, organizational and phys-
ical security measures designed to safeguard the confdentiality, integrity and
availability of personal information. Our Code of Conduct and related policies
include specifc guidelines on how employees should protect the confdential
information of those we have relationships with, including consumers, employ-
ees, service providers, commercial businesses or government bodies.
We have established processes and procedures to report and respond to
suspected or actual data privacy incidents that may compromise the
confdentiality, integrity or availability of personal information and provide our
employees the ability to make reports through our internal systems. Our
centralized process requires escalation to a dedicated incident response team
for severity assessment, mitigation, root cause analysis and corrective action.
We have processes to notify our regulators, customers and other individuals
when reportable incidents occur, as required by applicable law.
We regularly engage with lawmakers and civil society on policy issues related
to data protection and privacy, including the development and modernization
of U.S. federal and state privacy laws. We will continue to support policy that
protects people and their personal information, promotes organizational
accountability and enables benefcial data-driven innovation.

Cybersecurity
Like many fnancial institutions, our Firm experiences numerous cyber-attacks
on its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets on a
daily basis from various actors, including groups acting on behalf of hostile
countries, cyber-criminals, “hacktivists” (i.e., individuals or groups that use
technology to promote a political agenda or social change) and others.
As threats to cybersecurity grow in size and sophistication, protecting our
Firm, customers and vendors while enabling innovation is an important,
evolving priority. When we enter new businesses and adopt new technologies,
these risks and challenges multiply. For example, advances in artifcial
intelligence (“AI”), such as the use of machine learning and generative AI have
enabled malicious actors to develop more advanced social engineering
attacks, including targeted phishing attacks. This is why we devote signifcant
resources to cybersecurity. Our eforts are designed to stop malicious actors
from infltrating our computer systems to destroy data, obtain confdential
information, disrupt service, engage in “ransomware” or cause other damage.
We continue to provide clients and customers with resources and educational
content to help them address and prevent fraud losses, such as a client
ransomware guide and a toolkit to address compromised business emails.
To help safeguard the confdentiality, integrity and availability of our
infrastructure, resources and information, we maintain a robust Information
Security Program. It establishes policies and procedures to prevent, detect
and respond to cyber-attacks. Since our employees serve as the frst line of
defense, we educate, train and test our employees on how to identify potential
cybersecurity risks, protect the Firm’s resources and information, and report
any unusual activity or incidents. Employees are required to complete periodic
cybersecurity training and complete quarterly frmwide phishing tests.
We also require certain third-party vendors to comply with minimum security
and control standards, our Supplier Code of Conduct, and all applicable laws
and regulations.
The Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls ("CTC") organization,
working with each of our lines of business and corporate functions, identifes
technology and cybersecurity risks and is responsible for implementing and
maintaining controls to manage these threats. CTC assesses changes in global
threats and monitors our operations to detect and respond to them, including
those among the Firm’s third-party suppliers. We also conduct periodic
internal assessments to identify vulnerabilities, upgrade opportunities and
new defense layers. Our cybersecurity incident response plan is designed to
allow us to react to attempted breaches, coordinate our response with law
enforcement and notify customers, when applicable.
The governance structure for the CTC organization is designed to appropriately
identify, escalate and mitigate cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity risk
management and its governance and oversight are integrated into the Firm’s
operational risk management framework, including through the escalation of
key risk and control issues to management and the development of risk
mitigation plans for heightened risk and control issues. The Firm’s Independent
Risk Management function (“IRM”) independently assesses and challenges the
activities and risk management practices of the CTC organization related to the
identifcation, assessment, measurement and mitigation of cybersecurity risk.
The governance and oversight for cybersecurity risk management includes
governance forums that inform management of key areas of concern regarding
the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity risks.
The Cybersecurity and Technology Controls Operating Committee (“CTOC”) is
the principal management committee that oversees the Firm’s assessment and
management of cybersecurity risk, including oversight of the implementation
and maintenance of appropriate controls in support of the Firm’s Information
Security Program. The membership of the CTOC includes senior
representatives from the CTC organization and relevant corporate functions,
including IRM and Internal Audit. The CTOC escalates key operational risk and
control issues, as appropriate, to the Global Technology Operating Committee
(“GTOC”) or its business control committee or to the appropriate line of
business and Corporate Control Committees. The GTOC is responsible for the
governance of the frmwide Global Technology organization, including
oversight of frmwide technology strategies, the delivery of technology and
technology operations, the efective use of information technology resources,
and monitoring and resolving key operational risk and control matters arising
in the Global Technology organization.
The Firm’s Board receives periodic updates concerning technology and
cybersecurity risk matters. These updates generally include information regard-
ing cybersecurity and technology developments, the Firm’s Information Security
Program and recommended changes to that program, policies and practices, and
ongoing initiatives to improve information security, as well as any signifcant
cybersecurity incidents and the Firm’s eforts to address those incidents.
Our cybersecurity controls, governance and practices are based on recognized
industry practices12. We also have adopted the Financial Sector Profle from the
Cyber Risk Institute, which provides the framework by which these various
recognized practices are aligned with and integrated into our technology and
cybersecurity standards. These standards meet the requirements of more than
100 global regulations worldwide and are periodically updated.
Cyber-attacks are a threat not just to our Firm but also to our clients, customers
and the global fnancial system. We have increased our eforts to educate clients
and customers about the importance of disciplined cyber hygiene and protecting
themselves against fraud.
We also contribute to eforts to build and maintain systemic resiliency. We are a
member of the Financial Services Information Sharing & Analysis Center, an
intelligence-sharing cooperative for the fnancial services industry. Its more than
approximately 5000 member frms in 75 countries share best practices and exer-
cises to better secure the sector for the beneft of the public and the resiliency
and integrity of fnancial institutions. Our Firm also helped create the Analysis
and Resilience Center for Systemic Risk, an industry-funded nonproft organiza-
tion designed to mitigate systemic risk to the nation’s critical energy and
fnancial infrastructure.
JPMorgan Chase also participates in public-private partnerships and, over the
course of 2023, collaborated with the U.S. Government to better protect critical
fnancial infrastructure; engaged in the evolution of U.S. National Institute of
Standards and Technology ("NIST") standards, like zero trust; and responded to
the global proliferation of new rules, including operational resilience, cloud and
incident notifcation.
For additional information concerning the Firm’s cybersecurity risk management
and governance structure, see pages 149–150 of our Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2023.
12 Industry recognized practices include ISACA COBIT, ISO 27000 standards, FFIEC guidance, the Information Security Forum Standard for Good Practice, NIST SP800-53 and BSIMIM.

Business Ethics
We strive to be accountable, straightforward and honest in our dealings with customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders and other stakeholders. Our Code of Conduct, Business Principles, and other internal policies and procedures are
designed to promote a culture of respect that allows every employee to feel safe at work and empowered to speak up if they have concerns about unethical behavior.

Code of Conduct
Our Code of Conduct highlights the personal responsibility of every employee
to operate with the highest standards of integrity, transparency and ethical
conduct. It emphasizes the importance of avoiding conficts of interest,
protecting confdential information and maintaining a workplace that is free
from threats, intimidation and physical harm.
Employees must complete Code of Conduct training shortly after their start
date and periodically thereafter. Each year, employees must afrm their
compliance with the Code. In general, consultants, agents, and contract or
temporary workers are expected to comply with the underlying principles of
the Code. An additional Code of Ethics for Financial Professionals applies to
the CEO, CFO and other fnance, accounting, corporate treasury, tax and
investor relations roles.
We reinforce these expectations through various channels, including senior
leaders’ communications with employees, town-hall meetings, and culture and
conduct-related questions in our employee surveys. In addition, Acting with
Integrity is one criterion used to evaluate employees during their
annual reviews.
Employees are required to raise conduct concerns and report any potential or
actual violations of the Code of Conduct, other Firm policies, or any applicable
laws or regulations. Employees, directors, suppliers and customers can report
known or suspected violations to our Conduct Hotline via phone, online or
mobile device. The Hotline is anonymous, except in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions
where anonymous reporting is prohibited. It is operated by a third-party service
provider and is accessible 24/7 worldwide, with translation services available.
The Code of Conduct prohibits intimidation or retaliation against anyone who
raises an issue in good faith or assists with an investigation. Reporting
obligations to the Firm do not prevent employees from reporting to the
government or regulators conduct that they believe violates the law. It is our
policy to promptly review all potential violations and take action as
appropriate. Under our policy, confdentiality will be maintained to the extent
possible consistent with investigations.
Ethics and culture are key focus areas of our Board of Directors. The Board’s
Compensation & Management Development Committee is responsible for
reviewing the Firm’s culture, including thematic feedback from employees and
cultural initiatives, as well as reports from management regarding signifcant
conduct issues and any related employee actions. The Audit Committee
reviews the program established by management that monitors compliance
with the Code of Conduct and reviews the record of such compliance.
Financial Crimes and Anti-Corruption
Our Firm has a principle of zero tolerance for bribery and corruption. Our
global Anti-Corruption Policy prohibits ofering or giving anything of value to
— and soliciting or accepting anything of value from — anyone for a corrupt
purpose, such as improper payments or benefts to government ofcials or
private parties for a business advantage. The program includes a governance
structure managed by anti-corruption professionals with senior management
oversight, training and awareness activities, and monitoring and testing for
compliance. Employees are required to complete anti-corruption training.
We are also committed to participating in international eforts to combat
money laundering, sanctions evasions and the funding of terrorist activities.
We have implemented a risk-based, global Anti-Money Laundering Compliance
& Sanctions Program designed to comply with anti-money laundering and
sanctions laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we
operate. We are also part of the Wolfsberg Group, an association of banks
which seeks to develop frameworks and guidance for the management of
fnancial crime risks, including the foundational Wolfsberg Anti-Money
Laundering Principles for Private Banking.

Fair Lending and Banking Practices
JPMorgan Chase seeks to treat all individuals fairly and equitably in the conduct of its lending businesses and in
all jurisdictions where it conducts business. This is part of our mission of providing quality fnancial services to
existing and prospective customers in accordance with all applicable laws. In the United States, those fair
lending laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, as well as other state and local
laws. These laws require, among other things, the equitable treatment of all credit applicants without regard to
race, sex (including gender, gender identity and sexual orientation), color, national origin, religion, age, marital
status, disability, familial status, the fact that all or part of the applicant’s income derives from public
assistance programs, or the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer
Credit Protection Act. The expectation around fair treatment of our current and potential customers extends to
every aspect of a credit transaction, including not only how we review credit requests but also our advertising,
handling of pre-application inquiries, loan disbursements, and ongoing servicing of the loan.
Responsible Marketing
We believe it is important to be clear and transparent in our advertising and marketing. We seek to comply with
applicable laws and regulations on responsible and fair marketing practices. Our sales employees are expected
to communicate with customers in a clear, truthful and complete manner and to provide them with relevant
information to assist them in making an informed decision. Our lines of business are required to have an estab-
lished procedure for reviewing all new and revised marketing materials, terms and conditions, disclaimers and
other customer communications. These procedures include multiple layers of review — by diferent internal
functions — for clarity and accuracy. In addition, periodic testing is performed for compliance with the
procedures, and if necessary, changes are made to improve processes. Training programs are periodically
conducted for marketers to cover topics including marketing claims and regulatory marketing compliance.
Supply Chain and Responsible Sourcing
We expect our suppliers to demonstrate the highest standards of ethical business conduct and adhere to the law at all
times. Our Supplier Code of Conduct sets out expectations for our suppliers and outlines principles that are consistent
with the regulatory and legal framework that govern our industry. This includes conducting operations in an
environmentally and socially responsible manner. In 2023, we updated our Supplier Code of Conduct to further highlight
the importance of ethical conduct and compliance with legal and regulatory obligations, including clarifying suppliers’
responsibility to ensure their workforce meets the minimum legal age requirements for employment. We also expect
our suppliers to promptly report conduct concerns or actual or suspected violations of any law or regulation related to
Firm business, the Supplier Code of Conduct or any Firm policy.
We seek to provide equitable access to opportunities in the various areas in which we operate, including in our sourcing
engagements. Our approach to working with suppliers includes taking a broad lens that includes, without limitation,
companies that are owned and operated by women, ethnic minorities, military veterans, people with disabilities and
members of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer plus ("LGBTQ+") community. We seek to leverage the
strength of our procurement organization and business, while working with community partners, to lower common
fnancial barriers often faced by small and historically underrepresented businesses. We help them to understand quali-
fcations and support them in meeting frm requirements (such as, for example, providing access to professional
cyber-readiness assessments to build a secure cyber infrastructure, and key compliance resources like insurance, bond-
ing and other infrastructure and service tools that otherwise might be cost-prohibitive), so that they are prepared to
serve fnancial industry and other clients. Our Supplier Diversity program also encourages diversity and inclusion across
our portfolio of supply chain business partners. In 2023, our Firm spent approximately $2.3 billion on Tier 1 diverse sup-
pliers, who in turn spent $1 billion on our Tier 2 diverse suppliers13, including $2 billion with minority-owned businesses
and $1.3 billion with women-owned businesses14. Over 2021 and 2022, our top suppliers increased their own spend with
diverse suppliers, generating over $10 billion in new spending with diverse businesses15. For more information on our
Supplier Sustainability Program and how we engage with our suppliers to help them adopt enhanced environmental pol-
icies and practices, see page 39. For more information on our Supplier Diversity program, please see page 56.
13 Tier 1 refers to the amount of spend, or procurement dollars, that JPMorgan Chase spends directly with third parties, known as its suppliers, that provide goods and services in support of its business operations. Tier 2 refers to the amount of spend, or procurement dollars, that
JPMorgan Chase's suppliers spend with their Tier 1 suppliers.
14 Spend totals for minority-owned businesses and women-owned businesses include both Tier 1 and Tier 2 data.
15 JPMorgan Chase may not be the sole contributor to a Tier 1 supplier and therefore, there may be multiple contributors to the new spending of $10 billion with diverse Tier 2 suppliers. 24
Environment
Sustainable global economic growth and the prosperity of communities around the world require a
healthy environment, but escalating environmental issues such as climate change and biodiversity
loss pose increasing challenges. Addressing these environmental issues is important for preserving
our planet and promoting the long-term well-being of communities worldwide, as well as for
running a healthy and vibrant company that builds shareholder value.
As a global fnancial institution working with clients across the economy, we have a role to play:
supporting our clients’ environmental objectives and helping advance a sustainable global economy.
Our environmental sustainability strategy includes: scaling green solutions, balancing environmental,
social and economic needs, and minimizing operational impact. Pictured: Jackson, Wyoming

Our Environmental Sustainability Strategy
JPMorgan Chase helps our clients navigate the challenges and realize the economic opportunities of the transition to a low-carbon economy. We believe support-
ing our clients, through capital and advice, to accelerate their low-carbon transition objectives creates positive environmental benefts and generates long-term
fnancial return for our shareholders. We also strive to minimize our own carbon footprint and the impact our corporate ofces, bank branches and data centers
may have on the environment.
These eforts are guided by the three pillars of our environmental sustainability strategy — scaling green solutions; balancing environmental, social and economic
needs; and minimizing our operational impact — all of which is underpinned by our ongoing focus on accountability, transparency and engagement, which helps
us continue to evolve and remain responsive to stakeholders.

THE CLIMATE-NATURE NEXUS
In order to safeguard the planet’s health and promote global
economic prosperity and well-being, the world will need to
simultaneously address climate- and nature-related degradation.
We look to leverage our knowledge and expertise in the
climate space to inform and guide our nature and biodiversity-
related initiatives. Our aim is to expand our understanding of
how nature degradation, as well as the actions to conserve,
restore and promote sustainable use of the resources nature
ofers, can result in risks and opportunities for our business
and clients.
We continue to engage with our clients to advance their goals,
including as they relate to nature restoration (see page 28 —
Brazil’s $2 Billion Sustainable Bond) and to direct Firm
resources to promote nature conservation by selecting nature-
based carbon removal credits to address our operational
emissions that we are not yet able to eliminate (see page 37).
Our focus will continue to be on enhancing our expertise to
strategically support solutions that have a positive impact on
nature in a way that is aligned with our business goals and
benefts our clients.

Scaling Green Solutions
To meet global energy demand and achieve long-term environmental sustainability goals, the world will need to develop and scale a host of clean technologies,
business models and other solutions. As a global fnancial institution, we believe we can support these goals by providing fnancing and strategic advice to clients
and by helping investors put their capital to work.

Mobilizing Capital to Support Climate
and Sustainable Solutions
Developing solutions to advance the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon
economy will require signifcant capital, including capital to deploy and scale
clean energy solutions to meet the world’s growing energy needs and capital
to promote sustainable management of resources such as water and forests.
Our $1 trillion Green target — which we set in April 2021 as part of our
broader $2.5 trillion Sustainable Development Target (see page 9) — intends
to support the development and scaling of climate initiatives and sustainable
resource management.
We also support the market through our own Green Bond issuances. For
more detail on JPMorgan Chase Green Bond issuance, see page 84 in our
ESG Report Appendices.
Supporting Our Clients
We continue to broaden our eforts to support the climate- and sustainabili-
ty-related banking needs of clients, from early-stage and small companies
through to multinationals and other large corporations. We deploy our
capital and expertise to assist clients working to transition their business
model and operations to reduce emissions. As we expand our capabilities
across our LOBs, we aim to provide clients with diverse and innovative solu-
tions, while helping to grow the market for green and sustainable fnancing.
GREEN ECONOMY BANKING
As the need for climate solutions grows, so does the number of companies
focused on providing them with each requiring a unique combination of
fnancing and advice to achieve its business objectives. Our Green Economy
Banking team is called upon to provide subject matter expertise, banking
solutions and specialized credit underwriting to companies primarily focused
on decarbonization technologies, products and services. The Green Economy
Banking team focuses on three coverage areas — renewable energy,
sustainable fnance and climate tech — with senior bankers assigned to provide
sub-industry coverage within each of these areas. The team serves companies
across North America and the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region.
CASE STUDY
POWERING THE FUTURE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY:
FIRST SOLAR
In June 2023, JPMorgan Chase served as lead arranger for a $1 billion
revolving credit facility16 for First Solar, a U.S.-headquartered solar panel
manufacturer. The fnancing will provide enhanced liquidity and fnancial
fexibility to support the growth and expansion of First Solar, including
new manufacturing capacity and research and development infrastructure
in the U.S. First Solar employs a unique manufacturing process that allows
it to build its advanced thin flm solar panels quickly, sustainably and
cost-efectively — which can then be deployed to help decarbonize
electricity generation.
CASE STUDY SCALING GREEN SOLUTIONS: H2 GREEN STEEL
JPMorgan Chase acted as exclusive fnancial advisor to Altor as they led H2
Green Steel’s $1.9 billion17 capital raise. Proceeds from the private placement
are expected to be allocated to fnance the construction and development of
H2 Green Steel’s fagship plant in Boden, Sweden. Groundwork commenced in
the summer of 2022, and the plant is anticipated to be operational by the end
of 2025. Once operational, the plant is expected to be the world’s frst
large-scale green steel facility, featuring on-site hydrogen production using
Europe’s largest electrolyzer powered with renewable energy.
The H2 Green Steel plant aims to produce steel with up to 95% less CO2
compared to traditional blast furnace technology. The CO2 reduction will be
achieved by replacing coal in the steel production process with hydrogen
produced on-site. The plant is also anticipated to be the frst of its kind to
incorporate next-generation technology, digitalization, and a comprehensive
approach to circularity and recycling.
This transaction builds on our eforts to help scale green and innovative
solutions to support the global transition to a low-carbon economy.
16 JPMorgan Chase’s apportioned share in the transaction was $140 million. Per our Sustainable Development Target (“SDT”) methodology, only JPMorgan Chase’s apportioned share was counted toward our SDT.
17 Reported progress toward the Green objective of our Sustainable Development Target (“SDT”) for 2023 refects $1.6 billion of the total $1.9 billion. A $300 million equity raise, announced post-December 31, 2023, is excluded from the 2023 SDT progress calculation. 27

CORPORATE ADVISORY AND SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS
At JPMorgan Chase, we are dedicated to helping our clients achieve their long-term strategic goals through the
delivery of holistic advice, capital markets solutions, and targeted capital deployment. To coordinate these
eforts, in 2023, the Corporate Advisory and Sustainable Solutions (“CASS”) team was formed. The CASS team is
composed of the Corporate Finance Advisory team, the Center for Carbon Transition (“CCT”), the Infrastructure
Finance Advisory team and the Sustainable Solutions teams. The CASS team partners with coverage and
product groups across the CIB and CB, as well as the Corporate Sustainability team to drive global
cross-product coordination and allocate dedicated green capital of the Firm.
Center for Carbon Transition
The CCT provides clients globally with low-carbon transition focused advice and expertise and works with
industry coverage and product teams within the CIB and CB on a wide variety of strategic sustainability-focused
transactions. The team is also responsible for supporting our banking teams in identifying bankable green
business opportunities to meet client demands and amplifying our participation in the green economy.
The combined expertise of the CCT and other banking teams helps provide tailored insights and solutions to
clients who seek strategic advice as they adapt and grow their businesses. This includes providing advice on
clients’ long-term decarbonization plans and working with industry and product teams to structure unique
fnancing solutions in public and private capital markets to help clients drive progress toward their goals.
The CCT also works to develop and implement the Firm’s strategy to align, over time, its fnancing portfolio with
net zero emissions by 2050 and oversees the implementation of our Carbon Assessment Framework (“CAF”),
which helps us monitor our progress toward our net zero-aligned targets. For more information on our
targets, see pages 30–31.
Sustainable Solutions
Our Sustainable Solutions team is a specialist group of investment bankers who provide sustainability-related
advice and transaction support to advance sustainability solutions for interested clients and to provide them
with access to sustainability-focused capital across equity, debt and private markets. In Europe, the Middle East
and Africa, Sustainable Solutions also coordinates our Firm’s investment banking coverage of clients in
emerging green economy sectors. The group works with other investment banking teams across the CIB to
identify and execute on ESG-related advisory and product opportunities.
GREEN, SOCIAL, SUSTAINABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY-LINKED BONDS
Our Firm is one of the leaders in the underwriting of green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds, many
of which our clients intend to use to support their sustainability-related activities. In 2023, we underwrote $36.7 billion
in green, social, sustainable and sustainability-linked bonds, including $19.4 billion in green bonds18
.
CASE STUDY PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT: BRAZIL’S $2 BILLION SUSTAINABLE BOND19
In 2023, JPMorgan Chase served as Joint Lead Manager and Joint-Bookrunner for a $2 billion sustainable bond
issued by the Federative Republic of Brazil (“Brazil”). The issuance marks the frst-ever thematic bond issuance by
Brazil and is part of a series of initiatives that are being implemented by the country to promote and advance
sustainable development.
An amount equal to the net proceeds of the ofering is expected to be allocated to fnance and/or refnance eligible
green and/or social projects applicable under Brazil’s Sovereign Sustainable Bond Framework. Eligible projects aim
to contribute to the transition to a low-carbon economy, support environmental protection and advance
socioeconomic development in Brazil.
GLOBAL MARKETS SUSTAINABILITY CENTER
Within CIB Markets, the Global Markets Sustainability Center (“GMSC”) works with product teams to provide
sustainability and climate solutions across asset classes to help clients who seek to realize their sustainability strategies
and transition their portfolios to a low-carbon economy. An example is Investable Indices that incorporate sustainability
and climate considerations to help meet investors’ specifc requirements. These are tradable indices designed to help
investors gain exposure to distinct risk and reward profles, simplify the construction of alternative investments, tailor
risk-hedging strategies with greater precision, enhance long-term returns and construct more resilient portfolios.
Within equities, we ofer ESG benchmarks employing both long only and long/short strategies, and we continue to
innovate across asset classes.
We also direct a portion of the proceeds from certain JPMorgan Chase-issued structured notes20 toward supporting
charitable causes that promote sustainability. For example, in 2023, we supported two non-proft organizations; one
focuses on cleaning legacy plastic in oceans and preventing new plastics from entering oceans through rivers, while the
other focuses on providing free on-demand tutoring and college counseling for students from low-income
families in the U.S.

19 JPMorgan Chase’s apportioned share in the transaction was $667 million. Per our Sustainable Development Target (“SDT”) methodology, only JPMorgan Chase’s apportioned share was counted toward our SDT.
20 These structured notes with a charitable donation feature do not adhere to the green, social or sustainable use of proceeds criteria as defned by the International Capital Market Association (“ICMA”), are not issued under the JPMorgan Chase July 2020 Sustainable Bond Framework or

ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY THROUGH ESG INVESTMENT RESEARCH
Global Research produces a range of ESG-focused investment research to
meet investors’ evolving needs for timely insights and analysis to support their
broad range of sustainability and ESG investment strategies. In 2023, we
published approximately 300 ESG-related reports globally. Our published ESG
content includes regular thematic thought pieces on key developments in ESG
and sustainability; collaborative pieces between ESG and sector analysts that
assess ESG issues with industry context; and our ESGQ methodology, a
proprietary scoring tool that combines data designed to capture the long-term
corporate responsibility profles of companies and their evolution over time
with more frequently updated data points. In addition, we published several
cross-asset thematic publications, most notably focusing on governance,
biodiversity and adaptation to climate change. Moreover, the J.P. Morgan suite
of ESG fxed income indices (JESG index family) serves clients globally with
ESG benchmarks and has over $40 billion in assets managed against it.
We continue to address client needs for both thematic deep-dives and stock-
specifc views. Our ESG Discovery is a digital platform for research
content in the Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Latin America regions, that
allows clients to screen for and compare companies. The platform leverages
artifcial intelligence to identify the most relevant ESG themes for specifc
sectors and stocks, and centralizes views from the Firm’s sector and ESG
analysts on the companies’ exposure to and management of these ESG themes.

APPENDICES
Achieving long-term, inclusive and sustainable economic growth globally requires balancing environmental needs, societal advancement and economic stability. While the world needs to work swiftly toward environmental goals such as achieving
net zero GHG emissions by 2050, it needs to do so in a way that supports the world’s growing energy demand to power societal progress and fosters equitable energy access, reliability, security and afordability.
For us, recognizing the balance needed to achieve long-term sustainability informs our approach to environmental initiatives. Our initiatives are rooted in how we do business: this means serving our customers, clients and communities while
running a healthy and vibrant company. Examples of this work include using our capital and expertise to support clients in advancing their low-carbon transition goals, and in turn, advancing progress toward our own net zero-aligned targets
(see pages 30–31); deploying our philanthropic capital to support initiatives that help communities globally advance their resilience to climate change (see page 52); and evaluating and managing potential risks — such as E&S and climate risks —
within our business (see page 20).
Addressing Our Financed and Facilitated Emissions Key Milestones
A key aspect of our environmental sustainability strategy is how we engage with our clients who operate in
carbon-intensive industries, with a goal of helping them facilitate their low-carbon transition and encouraging
near-term actions that will set a path for global net zero emissions by 2050. In support of our strategy, we are
working to align key sectors of our fnancing portfolio with net zero emissions by 2050. To date, we have set net
zero-aligned targets for eight sectors: Oil & Gas, Electric Power, Auto Manufacturing, Iron & Steel, Cement,
Aviation, Shipping and Aluminum. Our 2023 Climate Report provides additional information on our net zero-aligned
targets, including new targets, updates to existing targets and progress we’ve made toward these as of December
31, 2022. Our Carbon Compass® methodology provides details on our approach to setting our net zero-aligned
targets, including key sectoral considerations, decarbonization pathways, and data and metrics used.

of what we determine is science-based, reasonable and achievable to serve the best interests of our business
while serving our clients and remaining true to our principles.
We aim to continue expanding this work over time for additional carbon-intensive sectors in our fnancing port-
folio. We plan to continue to engage with our clients in support of their decarbonization goals and journeys, and
aligning that work with science-based scenarios and evolving market practices for the fnancial sector. Progress
toward our targets is subject to market conditions, along with technological and public policy advancements.

ENERGY MIX TARGET OVERVIEW
The 2023 Climate Report outlines updates to our Oil & Gas Operational, Electric Power, and Auto
Manufacturing sector targets to align them with the IEA NZE scenario. It also outlines the expansion of the
boundary of our Oil & Gas End Use (Scope 3) target — now called Energy Mix — to include zero-carbon power
generation activity from our Electric Power portfolio, which is intended to better capture how our fnancing
helps to facilitate the diversifcation of energy sources by supporting the development of zero- and
low-carbon alternatives. As with our other targets, the Energy Mix target aligns to the IEA NZE scenario.
The Energy Mix target provides us with a more comprehensive view of the energy system and increases the
factors that can impact progress toward this target compared to our previous approach. Engaging with our
Oil & Gas clients to help them develop and implement their decarbonization strategies to reduce their Scope
3 emissions remains a key focus area. The updated target also enables us to focus on increasing our
fnancing of zero-carbon power generation while capturing changes in the level of fnancing we provide to
the Oil & Gas sector.

QUICK LINKS: 2023 Climate Report Energy Mix Overview
The Energy Mix target recognizes that a singular focus on
fossil fuels will not achieve the necessary transition of the
global energy system. It also refects the required build-out of
zero-carbon power which we expect will help reduce
emissions in the energy sector without compromising energy
security and afordability.
To complement our Energy Mix target, we maintained our Oil
& Gas Operational (Scope 1 & 2) net zero-aligned target. The
Oil & Gas Operational target focuses on decarbonization
actions, such as mitigating methane emissions and minimizing
faring, that we believe are the most relevant for emissions
reduction in the Oil & Gas sector. We also maintained our net
zero-aligned Electric Power target that focuses on the
decarbonization of electric grids. Given the Energy Mix
target’s overlap with the Electric Power target, our fnancing
of zero-carbon power generation is included in each targets’
calculations, which we believe is consistent with the IEA NZE
scenario’s treatment of global power generation.
To provide transparency and insight into the emissions
footprint of our fnancing to the Oil & Gas sector, we disclosed
our absolute fnanced and facilitated emissions covering
Scopes 1, 2 and 3 for upstream, refning, and integrated
companies (see page 30 of our 2023 Climate Report). Our
reported absolute fnanced and facilitated emissions for our
Energy Mix portfolio correspond to the end-use (Scope 3)
emissions from Oil & Gas clients. Electric Power clients within
our Energy Mix portfolio do not contribute to our absolute
fnanced and facilitated emissions, as zero-carbon power
generation leads to no end-use emissions. We provide details
on our methodology for calculating absolute fnanced and
facilitated emissions on page 32.
Carbon Compass® The Methane Emissions Opportunity
OUR CARBON ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK
As we continue to expand our sector-specifc net zero-aligned
targets, we are also focused on aligning our capabilities and
eforts to make progress toward them. We strive to use our
knowledge and expertise to help clients think through and act
on their decarbonization plans, while also aiming to reduce
the carbon intensity of key sectors in our fnancing portfolio.
Our Carbon Assessment Framework (“CAF”) adds a climate lens
to the way we make fnancing decisions. It aims to provide a
consistent, comprehensive, and data-driven approach to assess
our clients’ emissions and decarbonization plans. We use our
CAF to assess how new in-scope transactions may afect
progress toward our net zero-aligned targets and consider it as
one element of our decision-making for new in-scope
transactions in our targeted sectors. Assessing our clients’
decarbonization plans through our CAF also creates
opportunities for us to engage with our clients, understand
their views, plans and constraints, as well as their capital
needs. Our 2023 Climate Report provides further detail on our
CAF, how we use the framework in decision-making and
portfolio management, and how it supports engagement
with our clients.

MEASURING OUR ABSOLUTE FINANCED AND FACILITATED EMISSIONS
In 2023, we started reporting our fnanced and facilitated emissions on an absolute basis (i.e., absolute fnanced
and facilitated emissions) for sectors of our fnancing portfolio for which we have set net zero-aligned targets.
Our methodology for calculating absolute fnanced and facilitated emissions builds on international standards
and guidance while also aiming to align with the principles and parameters underlying our sector-specifc net
zero-aligned targets. We tailored our approach to focus on what we consider to be the most important sources of
emissions for each sector, accounting for our fnancial exposure to each of our clients in those sectors and — to
address one of the most signifcant challenges of measuring absolute fnanced and facilitated emissions —
minimizing distortion that may result from the efect of short-term market volatility on client valuations.
We believe this approach calculates absolute fnanced and facilitated emissions fgures that correlate with
real-world emissions performance of clients in our applicable sector portfolios.
We calculate absolute fnanced and facilitated emissions for a given sector portfolio as follows:
The following provides additional detail on our approach to determining each of the three elements used in our
calculation:
Financing: We include all lending (12-month monthly average balance of committed fnancing), tax equity
(12-month monthly average outstanding balance) and capital markets activity (100% of our participation,
on a three-year rolling average basis).
Company Value: For public companies, we use enterprise value including cash (“EVIC”) on a three-year
rolling average basis. For private companies, we use the sum of total company equity and debt as found on
the company’s balance sheet on a three-year rolling average basis.
Client Absolute Emissions: We include client absolute emissions within the same scopes and boundaries as
we have defned for each of our sector-specifc net zero-aligned targets.
QUICK LINKS: 2023 Climate Report Energy Mix Overview Carbon Compass® The Methane Emissions Opportunity
We aim to monitor evolving market practices on absolute fnanced and facilitated emissions measurement to inform our
methodology and plan to continue to report annually on this metric. While we believe that our approach is suitable for
our calculated absolute fnanced and facilitated emissions to correlate with real-world emissions performance, we have
also disclosed a version of this metric aligned to the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (“PCAF”)
methodology (see Climate Report page 34), recognizing the beneft of comparable industry-specifc methodologies.
The table below summarizes main deviations of our Carbon Compass® methodology from PCAF’s methodology, and

Minimizing Our Operational Impact
In addition to helping meet the sustainability objectives of customers and clients through our business, we also strive to
minimize the environmental impact of our own operations — including our real estate — and supply chain. Our reported
operational environmental footprint is driven primarily by the energy and resources we use to run our global network of more
than 6,000 corporate ofces, bank branches and data centers, as well as regular activities such as business travel.
Our approach to minimizing operational impact centers on managing our energy and carbon footprint, constructing and
operating more sustainable buildings, and implementing leading practices in sustainable sourcing and resource management.
Energy and Carbon Footprint Management
Our strategy for energy and carbon footprint management is guided by our carbon-related operational targets,
including reducing Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions by 40% by 2030 vs. a 2017 baseline and sourcing
renewable electricity for 100% of our global electric power needs annually. Our approach is also guided by the concept
of the GHG mitigation hierarchy, a structured approach designed to prioritize actions with the largest potential impact
on emissions reduction. This includes working to avoid emissions or minimize them as close as possible to their source,
both to maximize efciency of our operations and reduce our contributions to atmospheric GHG concentrations.
The following outlines key programs and initiatives we are pursuing in line with this strategy. Additional information is
also provided under Sustainable Buildings, on page 38.
OUR OPERATIONAL GHG EMISSIONS FOOTPRINT
The largest drivers of our operational GHG emissions are the energy we use for our build-
ings (e.g., electricity, heating and cooling) as well as business travel. Our key categories
of emissions include:
Scope 1. Direct emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels in buildings and
company-owned aircrafts and vehicles (i.e., natural gas, jet fuel, gasoline).
Scope 2. Indirect emissions from purchased electricity, which accounts for the largest
share of our overall footprint.
Scope 3 – Category 6 Business Travel. Indirect emissions from commercial air travel,
as well as ground transportation, hotel stays, etc.
For more information on our reported operational emissions footprint, see the detailed
environmental data tables available on our website.

Data centers. Our global strategic data center program seeks to
optimize the total capacity and distribution of our data centers,
including for purposes of minimizing energy use. In 2023, we continued
to streamline and consolidate our data centers, migrating toward more
efcient facilities. We are also continuing to expand deployment of
advanced hardware and software, such as real-time performance
monitoring and advanced cooling technologies, resulting in ongoing
improvements in energy and operational efciency in our data centers.
End-user technology. We also seek opportunities to improve the energy
efciency of technology used by our employees. In 2023, we
implemented a program to reduce standard brightness settings for
newly deployed monitors, resulting in decreased energy use and
associated emissions. We also used a new tool to measure real-time
electric power consumption of end-user technology setups (e.g.,
laptops, screens, software). With this data, we constructed a baseline
for average electric power usage that aims to help us monitor
year-over-year performance and measure the success of energy
efciency enhancements across diferent operating environments.
Building electrifcation. Electrifying buildings ofers several
advantages, including allowing for a greater shift toward renewable
energy sources, reducing both direct and indirect GHG emissions, and
lowering overall energy use. We are continuing an initiative to pilot the
design of fully electric and energy efcient retail branches, with
branches now in operation in California, New York and Missouri, and a
plan to open more in the future. Additionally, we are working to
transition to fully electric kitchens by replacing gas-powered cooking
equipment across our commercial locations.
Electric vehicles. To further reduce our operational emissions, we are
striving to meet a greater share of our transportation needs with EVs.
This includes working to meet our target to electrify 100% of our owned
vehicle feet by end of 202526, as well as working with suppliers to
increase the use of EVs for other key operational needs (e.g., ofce
shuttle transfers). We are also working to support employees
transitioning to personal EVs by expanding the availability of on-site
charging infrastructure at many of our corporate and retail locations.
Water and café services. We also seek ways to reduce energy use and
GHG emissions associated with the amenities provided in our ofces. In
2023, we began rolling out more sustainable drinking water taps across
our EMEA sites that provide up to 60% energy savings when in standby
mode. We are also trialing a tool in the U.K. to calculate the climate
impact of the dishes we serve, and we plan to use the fndings to
incorporate carbon labels into our menus. Through these eforts, we aim
to help diners make more sustainable choices while continuing to reduce
the impact of our global operations.
For more information on energy efciency and electrifcation in our
corporate ofces and bank branches, see Sustainable Buildings on page 38.
IMPLEMENTING AN INTERNAL PRICE ON CARBON
In 2022, we began the process of implementing an internal
carbon pricing initiative known as the Climate Impact
Contribution (“CIC”).
Designed to support internal transparency and
accountability and foster further progress in reducing
operational emissions, the CIC levies an internal fee on each
of our LOBs based on the operational GHG emissions
generated by their business activities. The fee is applied to
Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 Category 6 (Business Travel)
GHG emissions and is tiered to impose a higher fee (i.e.,
higher carbon price) on discretionary versus non-
discretionary activities — for example, elective business
travel versus operating our buildings and data centers.
Since its implementation, the CIC has yielded helpful new
insights on the emissions breakdown at the LOB level while
providing funding to further advance our operational
emissions reduction strategy.
25 Company use vehicles owned or leased by JPMorgan Chase for use for corporate activities, excluding specialty vehicles and those that form part of an employee’s compensation and beneft package.
26 Vehicle electrifcation target by 2025 for countries that have the infrastructure to support EVs. We aim to replace traditional internal combustion engine vehicles with hybrids in locations where the infrastructure does not yet support EVs.

SOURCING RENEWABLES
In addition to minimizing total energy consumption, we are working to further reduce operational GHG emissions by generating and
sourcing renewable electricity for 100% of our global electric power needs annually. This includes aiming to increase our use of on-site
solar energy systems, as well as negotiating long-term energy contracts and purchasing energy attribute certifcates (“EACs”).
On-site solar. Over the last several years, we have fnalized plans for on-site solar installations at the majority of our owned corporate
ofce buildings, with the aim of maximizing utilization of solar potential across our U.S. commercial real estate portfolio. In 2023, we
completed construction of two additional solar installations totaling over 12.3 MW capacity, bringing us closer to a planned total of more
than 90 MW of capacity by the end of 2025. We also continue to expand the use of on-site solar at our U.S. retail branches. In 2023, the
total number of retail solar installations grew to 570 branches in 17 states, for a total capacity of 19.4 MW when fully operational27
.
Long-term energy contracts. For our electricity needs that cannot be met with on-site renewables, we aim to procure additional
renewable electricity via long-term power purchase agreements (“PPAs”) and green power supply contracts. By securing these
purchases, we seek to not only meet our own energy needs but also to steer capital toward projects that can create important
co-benefts — such as increased local economic development, job creation and improved air quality — in the communities and regions
where we operate. Projects we have purchased electricity from include wind farms in Texas and Illinois, hydropower in New York and
other projects across the world.
EAC procurement. To continue to meet our target to source renewable electricity for 100% of our global electric power needs, we
purchase applicable EACs — e.g., Green-E certifed Renewable Energy Certifcates (“RECs”) and International-RECs. We believe these
instruments are an important lever in the commercialization of renewable energy, helping to foster market growth and sustainability
of the electric power generation sector. We purchase EACs that uphold Green-E principles including transparency, credibility and
avoidance of double counting.
INTEGRATING BATTERY STORAGE FOR 24/7 RENEWABLE POWER
Although we continue to expand the use of on-site solar at more of our locations,
the intermittent nature of solar power often limits how much of a facility’s total
power needs can be met by these installations. By integrating battery storage with
on-site solar, it is possible to store surplus power during periods of high produc-
tion (e.g., sunny days) so that a facility can continue to meet its own needs during
periods of low production (e.g., after dark). Such systems can also help optimize
the use of grid electricity based on variable price and energy mix throughout the
day to help reduce overall costs and emissions. For example, the fgure below
compares consumption and solar generation for a typical day at one of our com-
mercial ofce locations, highlighting excess solar electricity that could be stored
and used on-site instead of being exported to the grid.
By the end of 2025, we plan to install over 16 MWh of battery storage at two of our
U.S. ofce locations in Delaware and Arizona, which will inform our evaluation of
the potential for wider implementation in the future.

PURCHASING HIGH-QUALITY CARBON CREDITS28
To complement our ongoing emissions reduction eforts, we also seek to address our remaining unabated emissions by purchasing and
retiring high-quality carbon credits on an annual basis. Our goal is to avoid causing a net increase in atmospheric GHG concentration, while
also contributing to the development of the voluntary carbon market.
In 2023, our portfolio included credits from nature-based, hybrid and engineered removal projects, including improved forest management
(“IFM”), aforestation, blue carbon, biochar and bio-oil sequestration. By supporting diferent kinds of carbon removal projects, we aim to
help develop the broader market and scale emerging solutions. Over time, we intend to progressively increase procurement of long-term or
permanent carbon dioxide removals (“CDR”) with the aim of helping to accelerate and scale the development of related technologies. To that
end, in 2023, the Firm signed long-term agreements to purchase over $200 million in high-quality, durable29 CDR. The CDR from these
agreements are intended to remove and store approximately 800,000 mtCO2e from the atmosphere and to enable us to match every ton of
our unabated Scope 1 direct operational GHG emissions with durable carbon removal by 2030.
We remain dedicated to supporting a diverse range of project types, including nature-based projects that contribute to both carbon
mitigation and the preservation of natural ecosystems.
For additional information on how we are supporting an efective voluntary carbon market see our Carbon Markets Principles.
SUPPORTING NATURE AND COMMUNITIES THROUGH THE VOLUNTARY CARBON MARKET
In 2023, we purchased carbon credits from a variety of projects, including two IFM projects: one in the northwest of Durango State in
Mexico and one in western Maine in the U.S.
The project in Durango State takes place on over 240,000 acres of pine-oak forests under collective ejidal ownership, making it the
largest single IFM project in Mexico as of December 31, 2023. Ejidos are rural communities whose members depend on the forest land
for their livelihoods. The Pueblo Nuevo ejido is the second largest ejido in Mexico and has been practicing forest management for over
100 years. This project incorporates forest cultivation practices aimed at promoting greater biomass growth and, therefore, increased
carbon sequestration. It also aims to enhance the livelihood of members of the local communities by generating at least 350 direct jobs,
which would make it the second largest source of employment in the municipality. Other anticipated co-benefts of the project include
protecting the local watershed and restoring native vegetation. In addition, a portion of the carbon credit profts will be allocated to a
common fund that supports gender equality, infrastructure development and forest productivity projects.
The project in Maine sits on nearly 50,000 acres of hardwood and conifer trees near the Canadian border. Similar to the project in
Mexico, this project aims to extend the harvest rotation of the forest, sequestering more carbon through the trees’ continued growth. It
is anticipated that the project will support forest health and beneft fauna biodiversity in the region, including moose, black bear and
red-tailed hawk, among other species. The project is also expected to support the local economy through sustainable forest
management and forestry jobs.
28 Carbon credits and the market for them are evolving rapidly. Although we endeavor to source high-quality carbon credits verifed by independent third parties, the ability to
use carbon credits to fully and permanently address unabated emissions relies on certain assumptions and is subject to debate among experts. To learn more on the criteria we
prioritize when evaluating the quality and credibility of carbon credits, please refer to Carbon Market Principles paper.
29 Durable refers to the amount of time for which CO2 can be stored in a stable and safe manner. In this context, durable is defned as 1,000+ years of anticipated CO2 storage.
Our Carbon Market Principles
We believe the voluntary carbon market plays an important role in accelerating
the transition to a low-carbon economy. Our Firm participates in the voluntary
carbon market in a variety of ways, including providing strategic advice to support
clients’ transition eforts, connecting buyers and sellers, deploying capital to
promote decarbonization solutions, and purchasing credits as part of our eforts
to manage our own operational emissions. To support and strengthen our Firm’s
impact across these dimensions, in 2023, we published a paper on our Carbon
Market Principles. It outlines our perspective on the role that the voluntary carbon
market can play, current market challenges and how we believe we can leverage
our Firm’s unique position to support necessary progress. It also presents a set of
core principles that we reference when evaluating carbon credits to support our
operational sustainability eforts and engaging with clients on carbon
credit-related transactions.

Sustainable Buildings
As a fnancial services company, the bulk of our reported operational environmental impact stems from how we
design, build and operate our buildings. We, therefore, seek to take a holistic approach to enhancing the
sustainability of our real estate portfolio, with a particular focus on increasing energy and resource efciency;
reducing emissions; and creating healthy spaces for our customers, clients and employees. In 2023, we drove
progress through several key initiatives, including:
Retail branch efciency enhancements. Building on our past work on updated lighting standards, we are
piloting an update to our default specifcations for heating and cooling, building management and end-user
technology systems for new retail branches across the U.S. Together, these pilot enhancements have helped
reduce newly built branches’ average operational emissions by over 25% and water usage by over 20%,
compared to industry benchmarks.
Net zero-carbon branch pilots. In 2023, we opened additional pilots of our zero-carbon branch design in St.
Louis, Missouri and Bufalo, New York. Incorporating a comprehensive suite of advanced materials,
technologies and building methods — including low-carbon concrete, enhanced insulation, rooftop solar
arrays, full electrifcation and reclaimed asphalt in the parking lots — the new design aims to align to the
latest developments in low-carbon construction, providing embodied carbon savings of over 10% vs. industry
standard construction practices.
New global headquarters. Construction continues on our new global headquarters at 270 Park Avenue in New
York. The 1,388-foot, 60-story skyscraper is designed to incorporate a host of innovative features and
technologies to conserve energy, reduce GHG emissions, improve indoor air quality and enhance the
well-being of our employees. When completed, the new building is expected to be Manhattan’s largest all-
electric tower and to achieve net zero operational emissions. By piloting these and other enhancements, the
new facility will help to inform eforts to improve building performance across our global real estate footprint.
Smart buildings and retroftting. In addition to addressing energy and carbon impacts in new construction,
we also aim to enhance efciency at existing facilities. In 2023, we continued the deployment of AI-assisted
building management software at select Firm-owned U.S. corporate facilities. The software is designed to
reduce energy use while maximizing thermal comfort and indoor air quality for occupants. We plan to
continue its rollout across both our commercial and retail real estate portfolios. We are also working to reduce
the environmental impact of some existing facilities through retroftting. For example, as part of a planned
renovation of our Highland Oaks campus in Tampa, Florida, we are pursuing Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design (“LEED”) Gold and International Living Future Institute (“ILFI”) Zero Carbon
certifcations — both of which prioritize modifcations to achieve substantial energy savings.

The products and services we purchase to support our business are an important contributor to our
environmental impact. Our Supplier Sustainability Program focuses on enhancing our procurement process to
support the purchase of more environmentally friendly goods and services and engaging with suppliers to
better understand and aid them in adopting enhanced environmental policies and practices. In 2023, key
workstreams for the program included:
Supplier Environmental Sustainability Guidelines. Following the establishment of our Supplier
Environmental Sustainability Guidelines in early 2023, we made ESG-related questions standard in supplier
requests for proposal. The new questions ask suppliers to provide information related to our recommended
practices, including establishing and reporting on sustainability goals and policies, and measuring and
disclosing key environmental impacts.
Performance assessment. In 2023, we added new questions to our supplier control assessment, designed
to assess and monitor compliance with our Supplier Environmental Sustainability Guidelines while helping
identify performance improvement opportunities — such as implementing an environmental sustainability
program or a process to measure and report energy and water consumption.
Carbon reduction projects. Our sustainable procurement process is designed to embed sustainability in
the Firm’s overall sourcing and demand management processes. As part of this work, we are implementing
carbon reduction projects aimed at reducing our Scope 3 Category 1 (Purchased Goods and Services)
emissions. For example, JPMorgan Chase’s metal credit card programs have been a popular ofering to
nearly 15 million of our customers. Recognizing the larger emissions footprint of metal versus plastic cards,
we worked with a key metal card supplier to reduce the associated carbon footprint. JPMorgan Chase’s
metal credit cards are now made using 65% post-consumer recycled steel, and continuous improvement in
the manufacturing process has helped drive year-over-year reductions in embodied carbon. The cards also
use lightweight packaging to reduce emissions during shipping.
For information on how we engage with our suppliers and our eforts to improve supplier diversity, see page 24.
We encourage our employees to think about how they
can live more sustainably and how they can reduce
their environmental impact both at work and at home.
Through our Global Sustainability Series events,
employees are invited to participate in discussions
featuring external sustainability experts and the
Firm’s sustainability leaders to learn about opportuni-
ties to take efective action. Among the sessions con-
vened in 2023 was “Diving into the Global Water
Crisis,” in which employees learned how our Firm is
helping secure equitable and sustainable access to
water by mobilizing and catalyzing fnancing for com-
munities in emerging markets, and heard the story of
how one non-proft is bringing life-changing water
solutions to these communities. Another, titled “The
Road to Achieving the UN Sustainable Development
Goals,” featured the Assistant Secretary-General for
the UN Department of Economic and Social Afairs,
together with internal and external sustainable
fnance experts, taking stock of progress and remain-
ing challenges — including the important role
fnancing plays — in achieving the SDGs.
With more than 30,000 members, our GoGreen
program, a global network of nearly 60 employee-led
volunteer teams, works to foster a community of
informed, engaged and inspired employees who
contribute to our sustainability culture. The mission of
the GoGreen teams is to increase employee awareness
of sustainability initiatives at our Firm — including our
operational sustainability targets, and what we are
doing to meet them — as well as ofer employees
opportunities to learn about and engage in
sustainable activities at work, at home and in their
communities. During 2023, GoGreen team events and
activities included:
• Ofering hands-on cultural experience events in
support of UN World Water Day.
• Hosting local biodiversity-themed events in cele-
bration of UN World Earth Day.
• Joining local community organizations for
clean-ups of beaches, riverbanks and forest trails,
as well as events focused on planting trees,
clearing litter, removing invasive species and
constructing solar water heaters from reclaimed
plastic bottles for those in need.
• Staging sustainability fairs to provide employees
with opportunities to discover locally made
sustainable products and services.
• Sponsoring learning sessions with experts on top-
ics such as composting for beginners, using native
plants in landscaping to reduce water usage,
making your own non-toxic cleaners and how
municipalities manage recycling and waste.
• Participating in World Earth Hour — going dark for
one hour in our homes and in more than 30
JPMorgan Chase buildings.
• Encouraging employees to embrace our
environmental sustainability strategy through
campaigns aimed at promoting waste
minimization, including recycling and promoting
conscientious paper use.

Resource Management
By better managing resources and reducing waste, we seek to limit our environmental impact while increasing the efciency and efectiveness of our operations. Our current
focus areas include the following:

Reducing resource use. We continue to pursue eforts to minimize the use of
resources such as paper, plastic and water in our ofces. We are making
progress toward our goal to reduce our ofce printer feet by 65% by 2025,
compared to a 2017 baseline. Together with our employee engagement
campaign to reduce paper usage, these eforts help us make progress toward
our target of 90% reduction in ofce paper use by 2025 compared to a 2017
baseline. We expanded our single-use paper cup reduction program to all sites
globally in 2023, which has the potential to save approximately 20 million cups
annually, while also making continued progress toward our goal of eliminating
all single-use plastic items from our ofce pantries, cafés and conference
centers. Starting in 2019, we eliminated nearly all single-use plastic bottles in
our ofce locations in the U.S. and U.K., resulting in the diversion of an
estimated three million plastic bottles from landfll each year. Other recent
eforts include removing plastic cutlery from our U.K. ofces, transitioning from
plastic-based to biodegradable gloves in our U.S. kitchens and switching to
reusable lids to reduce the use of plastic wrap in our U.K. sites.
Reducing food waste. We have developed a variety of programs to reduce food
waste in our cafés. For example, in 2023, we launched a program for vendors to
ofer spent cofee grounds at nearly 30 sites for employees’ personal composting
or fertilizing needs. The program is expected to divert up to 4,000 pounds of
cofee waste from landflls each year and is now being expanded to sites in India,
Singapore and the Philippines. We also started composting at food service
locations at several of our corporate sites. The plan includes a three-phase
strategy to expand from food preparation areas to dining areas and then to ofce
pantry areas.
Reducing ofce waste. In 2023, we worked to expand our program to eliminate
desk-side bins in favor of centralized waste collection points across additional
commercial locations. This strategy helps increase employee awareness of
proper waste disposal, which can result in less contamination of recycling
streams, and saves time and costs associated with maintaining tens of thousands
of individual waste bins. When fully implemented, we estimate that the program
will help eliminate our use of more than 27 million waste bin liners annually.
Reducing electronic waste. To meet our annual target of diverting 100% of
e-waste from landflls, we focus on optimizing the recovery and reuse of
technology assets and strive to prevent the destruction of end-of-life assets
from contributing to landfll waste. We aim to maximize the useful life of our
equipment by strategically redeploying it in our own operations, donating it to
non-proft organizations serving communities in need, or selling it to companies
that can refurbish and sell it on the secondary market. Because of our
reuse-recycle-remarket strategy, we estimate we avoided over 300,000 pounds
of e-waste in 2023. This included the donation of technology to organizations
assisting military veterans seeking job opportunities in the tech industry. During
2023, asset recovery and reuse within our own operations helped identify total
savings of nearly $8 million.

2023 HIGHLIGHTS
INCLUSIVE HIRING We strive to give underrepresented individuals the opportunity to pursue rewarding careers.
Apprenticeships: Apprenticeships allow people to earn as they learn, providing an opportunity for individuals
to build their capabilities and gain relevant working experience, particularly for Low-to-Moderate Income
(“LMI”) individuals. Our Firm has provided philanthropic capital to support apprenticeship programs globally. In
2023, we committed $3.5 million among four organizations that are helping to grow apprenticeships in the U.S.
— growing our total U.S. apprenticeship philanthropic commitments to approximately $15 million since 2017. To
learn about how our Firm has adopted this approach to fnd talent and expand opportunity internally,
please see page 65.
Business Leadership: To help create work opportunities and skills development for young people throughout
communities in the U.S., we work with local businesses, educators and government leaders. For example, in
Miami, our Firm committed $10 million in 2022 over fve years to Tech Equity Miami. This funders consortium is
deploying $100 million toward initiatives creating pathways into tech-based careers and improving the ability of
small businesses to participate in the digital economy.
In New York, our CEO Jamie Dimon serves as an Executive Chair of the NY Jobs CEO Council, a coalition led by
CEOs of some of the largest employers in New York. The goal of this non-proft organization is to provide access
to high-potential jobs for low-income New Yorkers in underserved communities by connecting students and
workers with in-demand skills, removing barriers to training and jobs, and developing long-term, stable career
pathways through public-private partnership.
Second Chance Initiative: As part of the Firm’s inclusive hiring strategy, we have worked to remove barriers to securing
employment and create opportunities for people with criminal records. We strive to expand second chance hiring by
encouraging more employers to join and tap into the talent pool of qualifed candidates with criminal records and to support
common-sense policy solutions that will help Americans access a second chance to participate in the economy. To date, we
have worked with nearly 50 large, cross-sector employers as part of this initiative and hosted expungement clinics in key
markets such as Chicago, Columbus, Detroit and Wilmington, alongside community-based legal services organizations.
In 2023, we hired over 3,000 individuals with a criminal record — more than 9% of our new hires in the U.S. — including
to help expand community-based hiring eforts like those of our virtual call centers in Detroit and Baltimore. To learn
more about our virtual call centers, please see page 66. Our Firm also supports policy reform, such as Clean Slate
legislation at the federal and state level in multiple states in the U.S.
U.K. Aspiring Professionals Program: The Aspiring Professionals Program supports academically high-achieving
students — 16 to 18 years old — from low income families across the U.K., and provides them with mentoring, career
orientation support and work experience. Each year, as part of the program, students are invited to participate in a
two-week residential work experience at our Firm. Over the last 11 years, more than 800 students across the U.K.

as increase the efectiveness of skill acquisition to help people secure jobs faster. As an example, in 2023, our
Firm participated as one of several investors in a $40 million Series-C funding round for Transfr. The technology
company is using virtual reality technology to help students and job seekers explore diferent careers in an
immersive way and complete the initial phases of training for a new role quickly and at low cost.
Careers and Skills Policy Agenda: We support advancing a broad policy agenda to promote high-quality career
pathways through improving education and workforce systems and building durable partnerships between local school
systems, post-secondary institutions, education and workforce development agencies, and employers. In 2023, our Firm
released briefs on key federal legislation — including on the modernization of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity
Act, National Apprenticeship Act, and Higher Education Act. At the state level, our Firm supported House Bill 8 in Texas,
which was signed into law on June 9, 2023, and incentivizes community colleges to create programs that are better
aligned with workforce needs by establishing performance-based funding for skills training.

York, Delaware, Chicago and Columbus; and pitching masterclasses for over 35 women and diverse entrepre-
neurs in London and Frankfurt.
Supporting Underserved Businesses: Our Firm has a team of bankers based in markets across the U.S. whose
principal focus is understanding and supporting the unique journeys of diverse, women, and veteran business
owners. In 2023, we supported organizations that provide educational resources and mentorship to aspiring
and current entrepreneurs, including the Institute for Veterans and Military Families and Bunker Labs CEOcircle
program for veteran and military spouse business owners; the StartOut Growth Lab accelerator for LGBTQ+
founders; and the Latino Business Action Network Business Scaling Program and Tech Accelerator. We are also
a sponsor of the Women Presidents Organization, which facilitates networking and knowledge-sharing across
women business owners.
THOUGHT LEADERSHIP We aim to foster the success of all businesses that we support. This includes diverse
suppliers through direct engagement as their customer, as well as through philanthropic capital, and advocate for
policies that support small businesses and underserved entrepreneurs.
Small Business Research and Policy Agenda: We are supporting research and policies that would create better access to
capital, increase participation of small businesses in public and private sector supply chains and improve advisory assistance
for underserved entrepreneurs. For example, in 2023, the JPMorgan Chase Institute released a report on small business
credit card use, which found that small businesses with more cash liquidity were less likely to carry over credit card balances
from month to month — highlighting the beneft of having both cash bufers and credit in cash fow management.
Additionally, we further policy reform by engaging with stakeholders across businesses, government and nonprofts. In
2022, we published a brief outlining policy recommendations to lift fnancial barriers to procurement for small
businesses. In 2023, we continued work aligned with those recommendations, including by engaging with and
supporting external stakeholders focused on small business procurement — such as through our support for the
University of Washington’s Ascend program. Ascend connects underserved entrepreneurs with capital, supplier diversity
opportunities and business education resources.
CASE STUDY SUPPORTING LBAN
In February 2023, JPMorgan Chase became a corporate sponsor of Latino Business Action Network (“LBAN”) — a
Silicon Valley-based nonproft that partners with Stanford University to advance the growth of businesses in the
Hispanic and Latino community. As of December 31, 2023, we provided funding and support to help LBAN
deliver programming to over 500 entrepreneurs. This programming included workshops and resources to assist
these entrepreneurs in scaling their businesses. Additionally, we held roundtable and webinar events to provide
founders with procurement information and opportunities, invited over 90 companies to apply for our
procurement network and funded a grant to support the frst LBAN Startup Accelerator program.

Catalyzing Community Development
We support communities by fnancing the development of afordable housing, expanding access to homeownership, and providing access to capital for vital institutions such as hospitals and CDFIs. This support is intended to expand economic
opportunities in these communities and help neighborhoods thrive. In 2021, our Firm made a fve-year, $400 million philanthropic commitment to improve household stability and housing afordability for Black, Hispanic and Latino households.
To date, we have committed over $275 million of philanthropic capital in furtherance of this efort, providing support to over 170 organizations across the U.S. through grants, loans and equity investments to address the housing afordability
and access gap.

HOUSING AFFORDABILITY We aim to grow and preserve the supply of quality, afordable housing that meets the needs of underserved communities.
Helping to Create and Preserve Afordable Rental Housing through our Financing: In 2023, we extended more than $5 billion in lending
for afordable rental housing, helping to create and preserve more than 41,000 afordable rental housing units. This includes our Firm’s
Community Development Banking business and operation of our Commercial Term Lending Afordable Housing Preservation Program33
.

Advancing Innovative Housing Solutions with Philanthropic Capital: As part of our strategy to combat the housing afordability crisis, our
Firm is supporting organizations advancing innovative housing models that have the potential to be scaled throughout the U.S. In 2022, we
announced a $15 million commitment to fve nonproft organizations working to test and scale innovative models to increase the supply of
climate-resilient, energy-efcient afordable homes.
One of these organizations, the Neighborhood Partnership Housing Services, Inc. (“NPHS”), is constructing factory-built single-family homes
and accessory dwelling units (“ADUs”) on vacant lots. As of September 30, 2023, NPHS reported having built fve factory-built homes and
having shared information on factory-built homes with over 700 households through homeownership education and counseling. Additionally,
we are deploying capital to organizations with market-focused solutions. For example, our Firm invests in MSquared, a women-led
investment fund pursuing mixed-income, mixed-use new construction in high cost cities facing housing shortages. We also provide credit to
Habitat Capital, which creates and provides fnancial services and capital to facilitate homeownership opportunities and afordable housing
solutions in underserved communities.
Housing Supply Policy Agenda: Our housing market afordability policy agenda seeks to support regulatory and policy changes aimed at
addressing systemic bias in housing and encourage more efective models for boosting access to and supply of afordable homes. In 2023,
we published research outlining policy recommendations to increase afordable and maintainable homeownership opportunities. We
emphasized the importance of expanding the supply of afordable homes, including through support for a new Neighborhood Homes
Investment Act tax credit to fnance afordable homeownership opportunities, continuing to update industry underwriting guidelines to
permit ADU rental income in property underwriting and accelerating eforts to modernize manufactured housing. Our grant recipients are working to test and scale innovative models to increase the supply of climate-resilient, energy-efcient afordable homes.

Increasing Homeownership Opportunities: To address gaps in homeownership rates across communities, we are
expanding access to home lending products and services.
• Lending: Our Firm is committed to advancing economic inclusion and increasing homeownership opportunities and
has taken a focused approach in communities that have faced historical barriers to homeownership to provide
information and greater access to home loan fnancing. As of December 31, 2023, the homeownership rates for
households in Black and Latino communities were 45.9% and 49.8%, respectively, as compared to 73.8% for
households in Non-Hispanic White communities34. The homeownership gap is a critical driver of the racial wealth
gap, as home equity is the largest source of wealth for most families in the U.S35
.
• Community Engagement: Our Firm has invested in our people and external relationships to increase our presence
within majority-minority and LMI communities. We have approximately 1,400 lending advisors who serve all
customers and communities across our branch network. In addition, we expanded the Correspondent Community
Lending Program36, a component of our SPCP with a focus on majority Black, Hispanic and Latino communities,
beyond the current footprint, to include all eligible communities nationwide. We continue to cultivate a broad
network of external relationships, including real estate professionals, nonproft housing counselors, builders, and
correspondent lenders through sponsorship and engagement to earn trust and consideration.
We have increased access to credit through a wide array of products and programs to help homeowners achieve
maintainable homeownership. We have expanded our $5,000 Chase Homebuyer Grant, a component of our SPCP,
to more than 15,000 majority Black, Hispanic and Latino communities, more than doubling the geographic
coverage since the program’s launch in 2021. In 2023, we removed the DreaMaker income limit for customers
purchasing in the 15,000 majority Black, Hispanic and Latino communities where we ofer our Homebuyer Grant. To
help facilitate programs like SPCP, we actively engage with government-sponsored entities and advocacy groups in
an efort to increase stable homeownership through policy change.
Funding Innovative Models of Homeownership and Wealth Building: We support innovative models to help increase
access to homeownership through commitments of philanthropic capital. For example, we have committed $4.5 million
in philanthropic capital to Center for Community Self-Help (“Self-Help”) since 2021 to help lower fnancial barriers to
homeownership for LMI borrowers. Our Firm’s grant helped Self-Help launch a number of programs, including their
Equity Boost Mortgage product — a high loan-to-value mortgage product paired with $20,000 or more in down
payment and closing cost assistance, and a Savings Account for Emergencies (“SAFE”) mortgage reserve account for
fnancial emergencies. From the program’s inception and through November 30, 2023, the Center for Community
Self-Help reported that 85 Equity Boost loans were originated and 42 participants were active in the SAFE program.
Housing Access Policy Agenda: In 2023, we published a policy brief with recommendations for business and community
leaders to increase the availability of afordable and lasting mortgages. This includes support for expanded down pay-
ment assistance programs and a recommendation that lenders, investors, and insurers pilot and accelerate mortgage
reserve accounts to help homeowners weather economic shocks. The brief focused on recommendations to help more
families access and retain the wealth generated through their home. It also provided recommendations to eliminate bias
in the valuation of property, which builds on our Firm’s previous policy, philanthropic and business eforts to address
gaps in the residential appraisal process.
We also outlined steps to preserve generational wealth by untangling titles for heirs property homeowners, including
through the Uniform Partition of Heirs Property Act, which reforms state property laws to provide fractional or heirs
property owners with basic due process protections. Our Firm’s heirs property policy recommendations coincide with
grant support we provided to Howard University in 2023 to establish an Estate Planning and Heirs Property Legal Clinic.
The Clinic will help train the next generation of attorneys in this area of the law and will also support District of
Columbia residents with free legal estate planning services through law student-led clinics, including clinics hosted
at a local Chase Community Center.

Minority Depository Institutions: Our Firm understands and appreciates the unique role that Minority
Depository Institutions (“MDIs”) and diverse-led CDFIs play in our communities. Since 2020, we have invested
more than $100 million of equity in Black, Hispanic and Latino-owned and -led MDIs and CDFIs, having an
impact on more than 90 communities across 21 states and the District of Columbia. We have onboarded each
institution as a client and continue to provide access to our expertise, resources and network, creating
opportunities for business expansion, community engagement and mentorship.
Community Development Financial Institutions: CDFIs help fuel economic growth and improve quality of life
by providing vital fnancial services, such as loans, to small businesses and afordable housing intermediaries in
communities that are often underserved. Our Firm supports CDFIs by providing traditional fnancing; depository
products; resources and expertise as well as philanthropic capital, including grants and fexible credit products.
For the last two decades, we have provided fnancing to more than 100 CDFI loan funds specializing in
community development. In 2023, our Firm extended more than $240 million in lending and committed $24
million in philanthropic capital37 to CDFIs and community development intermediaries.
Governments: We provide fnancing and specialized knowledge to serve governments at the federal, state and
local level. In 2023, we provided more than $1.8 billion in fnancing to government clients. Our knowledge and
fnancing is helping governments implement contactless payment for public transportation, digitize online bill
payments, invest in infrastructure projects and essential equipment, and simplify tax and fee collection.
Healthcare, Higher Education and Not-for-Proft Institutions: We have a long history of providing banking
expertise, customized fnancial solutions and key insights to organizations that serve our communities’ health,
vibrancy and well-being. In 2023, we extended nearly $2.4 billion in fnancing to help clients in these sectors.
CASE STUDY SUPPORTING VITAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE DALLAS-FORT WORTH AREA
We support the government, healthcare, higher education, and not-for-proft institutions that help serve our
communities. In Dallas-Fort Worth (“DFW”), for example, we work with dozens of vital institutions, including the
DFW International Airport and Parkland Health.
DFW International Airport contributes to the local and national economy, with more than 2,000 direct
employees, and was the second busiest airport in the world by passenger trafc in 2022. Our Firm has served
DFW airport by providing services such as access to credit markets, merchant services and banking services.
We also support some of DFW's largest hospital systems, including Parkland Health — which supports those who
are primarily uninsured or on Medicaid through inpatient and neonatal care, primary care clinics, school-based
clinics and education programs. Our Firm has provided Parkland with banking services, funded workforce
development programs and hosted fnancial literacy sessions for employees.

CAPITAL FOR INTERMEDIARIES AND VITAL INSTITUTIONS
Strengthening Financial Health and Wealth Creation
Improving economic opportunity starts by helping people achieve their fnancial goals, be fnancially resilient and ultimately build wealth. Access to relevant, useful and afordable fnancial services is a critical foundation for achieving this.
However, individuals in LMI and underserved communities often have less access to fnancial services, less fnancial resilience to manage unexpected shocks and fewer fnancial resources to meet long-term goals. We are leveraging our reach and
expertise in order to expand access to banking services, develop products that meet the needs of LMI consumers, deploy services and philanthropic capital to support fnancial health, and provide fnancial coaching to support fnancial resiliency.
In 2023, we opened more than 165 branches across the U.S., continuing to support our clients through the largest branch network in the country.

(see pages 54-59), we pledged to help one million consumers open low-cost checking or savings accounts over
fve years through expanded awareness of our Chase Secure BankingSM product. Chase Secure BankingSM
accounts have no overdraft fees and provide users with the benefts of being a Chase customer, like access to
thousands of fee-free ATMs, free money orders and cashier’s checks, Chase’s mobile app, and support from
bankers in person or by phone. In 2023, we helped customers open more than 317,000 net new low-cost
checking accounts with no overdraft fees. Since its launch in 2019, we have made Chase Secure BankingSM
available to more than 1 .8 million accounts t o help people access mainstream banking. Additionally, since 2019,
we have opened a total of 16 Community Centers branches — including two branches in 2023 — and have hired
149 community managers across the U.S.

Supporting Innovations in Financial Health through Philanthropic Capital: We made a $3 million grant in
2022 to support the growth of SaverLife, a nonproft leveraging technology to advance consumer fnancial
health. Through their platform, SaverLife designs, tests and scales personalized fnancial health content and
behaviorally informed savings innovations. SaverLife reported that as of December 31, 2023, it has grown to
serve over 600,000 LMI consumers, enabling 56% of SaverLife’s consumers to increase their fnancial health
score and double their savings rate. This support has also helped SaverLife to scale its transactional dataset to
produce actionable research grounded in community insights and contribute to national research and policy
discussions on topics such as consumer fnancial behavior, fnancial health implications of tax credits, and the
impact of climate events on household fnances.
PATHWAYS TO CREDIT AND MANAGING CASH FLOW We aim to serve LMI and underserved customers
through credit products and resources to improve credit. Additionally, we ofer tools and insights to help customers
more easily manage their day-to-day fnances.
Expanding Access to Credit and Cashfow Management through New Products and Product Enhancements: As part
of the Ofce of the Comptroller of the Currency’s Roundtable for Economic Access and Change (“Project REACh”), our
Firm was the frst participating institution to launch an initiative to provide credit to customers with no credit history.
Since the launch of Project REACh, we have approved credit cards for over 56,000 new-to-credit customers based on
cash fow underwriting. This efort supports credit building and expands access to lower-priced mainstream credit
products, which could eventually include a mortgage to support homeownership — an important source of generational
wealth. In 2023, we launched the Chase Freedom Rise Card product, which is designed for new-to-credit customers.
Additionally, our Firm enhanced Credit Journey with a feature that provides customers with a personalized action plan
to build their credit score. In 2023, approximately two million Chase customers started a plan; those who successfully
completed a plan experienced an average score increase of 20 points or more.
In addition to facilitating pathways to credit, our Firm provides resources to help consumers manage their day-to-day
cash fows. In 2023, we introduced Spending Planner, a digital tool available in the Chase Mobile® app and Chase Online.
The tool provides customers with a view of how much they spend and earn over diferent time periods, as well as
insights into their spending across diferent categories, such as groceries and entertainment. Additionally, Chase
customers can set up a budget based on their monthly income and savings goal, and track their spending against the
budget throughout the month.

MONEY SMART FINANCIAL COACHING
PROGRAM
We supported Westchester Community College’s (“WCC”)
launch and development of the Money Smart Financial
Coaching Program (“MSFCP”), which explored the correlation
between one-on-one fnancial coaching and student success
rates. WCC concluded through their research40 that fnancial
coaching has a signifcant positive correlation on higher
education completions and fnancial security. WCC reported
that the pilot program, which took place from 2017 to 2019,
demonstrated a 91% persistence rate of degree seeking
students remaining enrolled in the college and/or succeeding
in their education, as compared to the 70% persistence rate
for the college.
Based on the success and fndings of the pilot, we provided an
additional $2.5 million in support to The National Council for
Workforce Education (“NCWE”) to replicate the model across
seven public and private colleges, including community
colleges and historically Black Colleges and Universities
(“HBCUs”) — resulting in similar fndings. In 2023,
we co-designed the frst-ever credit-bearing fnancial health

Entertainment at Long Island University in Brooklyn, NY. To
amplify the impact of the course, students also received
fnancial coaching through the MSFCP with NCWE.

Helping Low Carbon Solutions Reach Communities: The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (“GGRF”), a pool of funds

the U.S. In 2023, we supported several organizations, with the aim of fostering a well-informed and diverse coalition of
organizations applying for these funds, to bring the benefts of the energy transition directly to more communities,
including communities of color. For example, we provided philanthropic capital to support Climate Policy Initiative, RMI
(formerly known as Rocky Mountain Institute), and the Center for Impact Finance at the University of New Hampshire’s
Carsey School of Public Policy to provide data and technical assistance to the prospective applicants.
We also made a grant to support the African American Alliance of CDFI CEOs to help organize and convene the Community
Builders of Color Coalition, a coalition of organizations that applied for GGRF funds. Additionally, we provided philanthropic
capital to the Solar and Energy Loan Fund (SELF) to support the launch of the Southern+ Climate Equity Accelerator, an

CASE STUDY CLIMATEWELLS
In 2022, First Republic Bank41 provided funding to ClimateWells to help accelerate and pilot the process
for early retirement of low-producing42 oil and gas wells in the U.S. ClimateWells uses a science-based
approach to help reduce emissions from U.S. oilfelds — leveraging the voluntary carbon market and
lifecycle emissions measurement tools to create verifed emission projects that incentivize the early
remediation and retirement of low-producing oil and gas wells while generating avoidance credits43
.
ClimateWells streamlines the process of retiring wells, reducing typical cost and logistical barriers while
creating environmental, social and economic benefts. In addition to reducing pollution, the
decommissioning process positively impacts communities by creating local job opportunities,
particularly for former oil and gas industry employees, and helps reduce the health impact to local
communities from industrial emissions. As of December 2023, ClimateWells had begun the development
of a project for the early retirement of wells in the Wilmington community of Los Angeles.
41 On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (“FRB”) from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as receiver.
42 Low-producing oil and gas wells are responsible for approximately half of the methane emitted from all well sites in the U.S., while accounting for only 6% of U.S. oil production. Source: EDF

Our Racial Equity Commitment
In October 2020, JPMorgan Chase announced our $30 billion Racial Equity Commitment to help close the racial
wealth gap and advance economic inclusion among historically underserved communities in the U.S., including
Black, Hispanic and Latino customers and communities. The Racial Equity Commitment recognizes persisting
economic inequities as well as the identifed needs of impacted communities refecting our view that the
commitment has both economic and business benefts. The commitment includes incremental lending and
equity investments44, as well as philanthropic capital, products and services focused on the following key areas:
• Increasing homeownership
• Expanding afordable rental housing and support for vital community institutions
• Supporting the growth of small businesses
• Expanding opportunities to increase spend with Black, Hispanic and Latino suppliers
• Improving fnancial health and access to banking
• Investing in Minority Depository Institutions (“MDIs”) and Community Development Financial
Institutions (“CDFIs”)
• Providing Philanthropic Capital to advance an inclusive economic recovery and support Black, Hispanic,
Latino and underserved communities. Please see the Inclusive Growth section from pages 42–52 for our
more detail on our philanthropic eforts.
• Accelerating investment in our employees and building a more diverse and inclusive workforce. Please see

Areas of Focus and Strategies
The breadth of our Firm’s resources allows it to help address the racial wealth
gap and expand economic opportunity, including for communities that have
historically been left behind. The following explores each of the Racial Equity
Commitment’s pillars and shares information on our strategic approach.
We continue our eforts to advance equitable access to homeownership,
including for households in Black, Hispanic and Latino communities. In doing so,
we believe we can help stabilize and revitalize communities across the country.
Our commitment to increase homeownership is inclusive of every income level
because homeownership inequity exists across the fnancial spectrum.
We are executing on our six-pillar Community and Afordable Lending strategy
focused on building our team and cultivating external relationships to increase
our presence in communities we serve, expanding access to credit through our
products and programs, creating awareness and dispelling myths about
homeownership, and participating in policy reform to further foster inclusive
growth. We originated more than 14,000 home purchase and refnance loans for
Black, Hispanic and Latino households across the economic spectrum in 2023.
We continue to look for opportunities to pursue innovative fnancing solutions
and work with public and private resources to support the creation and
preservation of afordable housing. We make data-driven policy
recommendations aimed at preserving and increasing availability and
equitable access to afordable housing for renters.
Nearly all borrowers participating in our Commercial Term Lending Afordable
Housing Preservation Program45, which ofers interest rate incentives to
owners and operators, have created or maintained designated afordable rent
pricing for more than 192,000 units and re-qualifed for an interest rate
incentive since the program’s inception.
At the onset of our Racial Equity Commitment, we announced a $400 million
increase of Low Income Housing Tax Credit (“LIHTC”) investments, which
leverage equity commitments to construct and rehabilitate afordable rental
housing. After meeting that initial $400 million target, in 2022, we increased
our commitment to target an incremental $400 million each year — for a
grand total of $2 billion over fve years. Moreover, as many as 80,000
afordable rental units have received committed investments from our Tax
Oriented Investment (“TOI”) activity, which is comprised of our Preservation
Funds and LIHTC investments46. This work helps meet a critical need in the
U.S. for additional afordable housing.
In 2023, the Workforce Housing Solutions group (formerly Capital Solutions)
provided its frst construction loan to support the development of a new 376-
unit afordable and workforce housing community in downtown Los Angeles,
California without the use of public subsidy. Workforce Housing Solutions helps
fll a fnancing gap between afordable housing for low-income families funded
with LIHTC investment and unrestricted market-rate housing. Although this
work was not part of the originally announced commitment, it is an example
of our Firm’s ongoing eforts to expand afordable housing.
We understand that historically underserved communities need more than hous-
ing. We are helping to address additional factors that can have a generational
impact on families through our $500 million New Market Tax Credit (“NMTC”)
commitment. Although we reached our goal in 2023, we plan to continue to use
our NMTC fnancing to help create access to medical services, healthy foods, job
creation and education in underserved communities.
SUPPORTING THE GROWTH OF SMALL BUSINESSES
Supporting small businesses in majority Black, Hispanic and Latino communities
continues to be a priority, including expanding access to credit and introducing
new product oferings. Our Firm also launched an SPCP for small businesses in
historically underserved areas in 2022 and, in 2023, expanded the program to
include business credit cards. Since its launch, the SPCP has helped more than
16,000 small businesses access credit through credit cards and small
business loans.
Additionally, since launching the Racial Equity Commitment, we have hired 58
local Senior Business Consultants who provide complimentary one-on-one
coaching and host educational events, community workshops, and business
training seminars to support entrepreneurs in underserved communities
across 21 U.S. cities.
Our Firm understands and appreciates the unique role that MDIs and CDFIs
play in our communities. Our support of these essential institutions is intended
to help maximize their goal to provide access to credit and fnancial services in
historically underserved communities. We exceeded our commitment by
investing more than $100 million of equity in Black, Hispanic and
Latino-owned and -led MDIs and CDFIs47 in 2021, and we continue to provide
access to our expertise, resources and network, creating opportunities for
business collaboration, community engagement and mentorship.
45 Borrowers in the Preservation Program beneft from a graduated interest rate incentive to maintain rental unit afordability and must re-qualify annually.
46 Rental units from TOI activity represent the actual number of units from October 2020 to December 31, 2023. Note, our Firm reports 100% of the units, not scaled to the percentage of equity we hold in the entity that owns the property and not reduced for any units that are not required
to be rent or income restricted. Eligibility for Preservation Funds is determined based on the operating agreements of the partnership or Limited Liability Corporations (“LLCs”) that include a requirement that at least 50% of the Preservation Fund assets are to be invested in afordable
rental housing; eligibility for LIHTC investments is determined based on project documentation, including (1) for completed projects, Form 8609, Low-Income Housing Credit Allocation and Certifcation from an issuing agency and (2) for projects under construction, tax credit reservation
letters from an issuing agency and/or legal opinions on the investments that evidence the project meets the tax credit eligibility criteria.
47 Includes one fnancial institution that provides products and services to MDIs and CDFIs to support Black, Hispanic and Latino communities.

IMPROVING FINANCIAL HEALTH AND ACCESS TO BANKING
We continue our eforts to improve the fnancial health and resiliency of customers and communities. We plan
to continue opening more branches — including Community Center branches in LMI communities — and hiring
additional Community Managers, who are local ambassadors for our Firm and responsible for building and
nurturing relationships with key community leaders, nonproft organizations and small businesses at the
neighborhood level.
We have approximately 300 community-style branches, including our 16 Community Centers, that continue to
host community events, fnancial health workshops, skills training and small business pop-up events. These
branches are making a diference in our relationship with customers. Customers near community branches
report greater consideration of using Chase products and express improved trust in banking with Chase48
.
Our eforts extend beyond education, as we continue to seek ways to design products that can help customers
build a stronger fnancial foundation. In addition, products that we have launched in the past, like our Secure
Banking Low-Cost Checking account, have proven to have an impact. Our Secure Banking customers report
saving on average of more than $40 per month in monthly fees compared to experiences with alternative
fnancial services49. For more information on Chase Secure BankingSM, please see page 50.
SUPPLIER DIVERSITY
As part of our Racial Equity Commitment, we pledged to spend an additional $750 million with Black, Hispanic
and Latino-owned suppliers by 2025. We reached this goal in 2023, two years ahead of schedule, and aim for
this work to continue beyond the fve-year commitment.
We have established a supplier recoverable grant program to help emerging and historically underrepresented businesses,
including but not limited to, qualifed Black, Hispanic and Latino-owned businesses, access key compliance resources that
may otherwise be cost-prohibitive like cybersecurity, insurance bonding, and other infrastructure services and tools.
Our approach to working with suppliers includes leveraging the strength of our procurement organization,
business and community partners to lower the common barriers faced by small or historically
underrepresented businesses. The Firm assists businesses in understanding the qualifcations and accessing
growth capital to help them meet minimum corporate requirements, including professional cyber-readiness
assessments, so they can build a secure cyber infrastructure and are prepared to serve fnancial industry clients.
Our pledge to Black, Hispanic and Latino-owned suppliers50 furthers our Firm’s goal to create a stronger, more inclusive
economy; our business with diverse suppliers as part of this commitment is estimated to have supported over 5,000
jobs51. For more information on our Firm’s supplier diversity eforts, please see the Supply Chain and Responsible
Sourcing section on page 24.
For more information on how we are making an impact, please see the Inclusive Growth section from pages 42–52.
We are advancing economic inclusion through fnancial health workshops and community events across the country. Pictured: Chase Community Branch, Little Havana, Miami, Florida
48 When customers in markets that have a community branch were asked survey questions in Q3 2021 and Q2 2023, they answered more favorably in Q2 2023, compared to results for the same questions and same periods in comparable markets that do not have a community branch.
There was an 8-point improvement for the survey question, “How likely are you to consider [Chase] as a provider the next time you’re in the market for a checking or savings account?” and a 13-point improvement for the survey statement, “Chase is a bank I trust.”.
49 The average monthly fees saved amount is based on a survey conducted from October 17–25, 2023 where 1,018 Secure customers were asked “With your Chase Secure Banking account, how much money do you think you’re saving on fees in an average or typical month compared to the
amount you were spending on fees before you had the account?” These customers reported saving an average of more than $40 per month on fees for money orders, check cashing, US remittances, and bill paying services — if annualized, approximately $500 per year.
50 Black, Hispanic and Latino-owned suppliers are suppliers who are certifed Minority Business Enterprises (MBEs), which have been designated by a third-party as being 51% or more owned, operated and controlled by one or more people who are Black, Hispanic and Latino.
51 Based on an input-output economic impact model analysis for the period of January 1, 2021 to June 30, 2023, performed by Supplier.IO, which estimated that the Firm’s $750 million spend helped support over 5,000 jobs. The model quantifes our Firm’s economic contribution, including
jobs supported, to estimate how each dollar of “input,” or direct spend, cycles through the economy. The model aggregates across all U.S.-domestic companies; the calculations cannot be applied to individual companies and may difer from actual jobs supported at specifc companies.

CASE STUDY SUPPORTING GREATER SPEND WITH DIVERSE SUPPLIERS
Pride Global, a contingent workforce management services company, is a diverse-owned business and a
JPMorgan Chase Gold Supplier55. We expect Gold Suppliers to establish goals to incorporate more diverse
businesses into their own supply chains and increase incremental spend with diverse suppliers.
We supported Pride Global in establishing its supplier diversity program by providing mentorship and a
training course. Within the program’s frst year, Pride Global reported growth in new diverse supplier spend
and increased the number of Black, Hispanic and Latino suppliers in its supply chain.
CASE STUDY REDEVELOPING HOLLYGROVE NEIGHBORHOOD IN NEW ORLEANS
Our Firm provided New Orleans Restoration Properties with construction fnancing to rehabilitate existing
buildings and to develop new housing in the historically Black Hollygrove neighborhood in New Orleans,
Louisiana. Portions of Hollygrove had previously sat in disrepair for years due to a lack of funding following
the 2005 Hurricane Katrina. We purchased tax-exempt bonds to provide $7.6 million in construction fnancing.
As of December 2023, construction was nearly complete on a series of 32 new housing units called Grove
Place. The development includes 23 historic buildings that have been rehabilitated and nine newly constructed
units, as well as a community center, garden and community greenspace. Crafted as duplexes and triplexes,
the rental units will be reserved for households earning between 20% to 60% of the area median income.
CASE STUDY BRINGING THE RACIAL EQUITY COMMITMENT TO LIFE LOCALLY
Community Managers play an important role in bringing our Firm's Racial Equity Commitment to life at a
local level. As of December 31, 2023, we had 149 Community Managers working to help increase awareness
of fnancial health resources, including by hosting interactive programs in their communities and
connecting community members with experts on topics such as budget building, understanding credit,
saving, investing, small business and homeownership.
Our Community Managers seek to meet the specifc needs of their communities using available resources
and oferings of the Firm. For example, in 2023, a Chase Community Manager in Atlanta held a
back-to-school event at the Summerhill Community Branch, inviting community members to fnancial health
workshops. Participants were able to learn more about the digital fnancing tools ofered by Chase, such as
Budget Builder, Autosave and Credit Journey.
CASE STUDY SUPPORTING A HEALTHCARE AND RESEARCH CENTER IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
In 2023, our Firm made a NMTC equity investment into $32.5 million of NMTC allocation to help fund the
construction of Washington, D.C.-based nonproft Whitman-Walker’s new 118,000-square-foot healthcare
and research center on the campus of St. Elizabeth’s East in the Congress Heights neighborhood in D.C.
The new center has the capacity to serve an additional 10,000 patients and clients, as compared to the
original location. The center also plans to expand clinical trials from 19 to a total of 60 and add more dental
health facilities to historically underserved Wards 7 and 8 of the district. The deal was led by Commercial
Banking’s NMTC team and builds on our Firm’s eforts to fund developments for communities
beyond housing needs.

Responsibility and Transparency
in Meeting Our Commitment
Our Firm’s Community Impact Team is responsible for program-wide oversight
and governance of the Racial Equity Commitment. The Community Impact Team
works with market business leaders to deliver resources at the local level. These
market business leaders include representatives from our lines of business and
senior executives from applicable corporate functions. This is done in
coordination with our Firm's Public Engagement team, which periodically briefs
external stakeholders, including civil rights organizations, consumer policy
groups, nonproft organizations, civic leaders, trade associations, and diverse
chambers of commerce for opportunities to collaborate.
The Public Responsibility Committee of the JPMorgan Chase Board of Directors
provides oversight of this work and is briefed on the Firm’s progress.
Our Journey and The Road Ahead
Our work to advance economic inclusion did not begin with the Racial Equity
Commitment. Rather, the Racial Equity Commitment was born out of years of
leveraging our resources to uplift customers and communities, while driving
shareholder value.
These experiences include our eforts in Detroit following its bankruptcy, the
implementation of our AdvancingCities program across the globe, the formation
of our PolicyCenter to develop evidence-based policy solutions to expand
inclusive economic opportunity, and the establishment of our seven DEI Centers
of Excellence (“COEs”), which support the economic development of communities
globally. More information about our COEs can be found on page 62.
While our Firm has invested and fnanced more than $30 billion toward
elements identifed in our Racial Equity Commitment in three years, we are
aware of the work that remains to be done, both in meeting each of our sub-
commitments and in continuing to support the communities that we serve. We
plan to continue our eforts, beyond the original fve-year commitment, to
leverage the scale and reach of our business to advance equity for
underserved communities and help to close the racial wealth gap. As part of our Racial Equity Commitment, our Firm has invested and fnanced billions of dollars to help
preserve and expand afordable rental housing. Pictured: Washington, D.C.

Framework drives feedback for our senior leaders, including Operating
Committee members, on inclusive leadership behaviors, practices and progress
on the Firm’s DEI priorities as part of the year-end performance review.
Culture of Respect, Equity and Inclusion
Across the Firm, we continually work to create and reinforce a culture of
respect, equity and inclusion, in which our employees are empowered to
bring their best, most productive selves to the workplace, leveraging their
unique perspectives and experiences to deliver against frm objectives. We do
so by creating forums for employee engagement, initiatives to advance
inclusion and share diverse views, and education and training programs
designed to identify ways that all of our employees can contribute to a
dynamic and inclusive culture.
Our Business Resource Groups ("BRGs") are an important part of how we do
this. These groups serve as networks for employees to connect with
colleagues and grow professionally, while advancing our Firm’s DEI strategies.
Recognizing the intersectionality of the diferent groups represented by our
BRGs, we are taking steps to promote and facilitate cross-BRG collaboration.
For a list of our Firm’s BRGs, please see page 68.
Our Asian, Black, Hispanic and LGBTQ+ Executive Forums convene senior

In October 2023, JPMorgan Chase hosted the Inclusive Capital Summit in New York City that brought more
than 150 entrepreneurs and investors from underserved communities across the U.S. together for two days
of programming and networking. Our Firm’s business leaders, including COE leaders, shared resources and

support those at earlier points in their entrepreneur journey.
CASE STUDY BUILDING FINANCIAL HEALTH FOR LATINO AND HISPANIC COMMUNITIES
In 2023, JPMorgan Chase launched the Building Nuestro Futuro Wealth Summit aimed at empowering all
people, including individuals in Hispanic and Latino communities, with fnancial knowledge and resources.
Hosted in Miami and Los Angeles, this two-part series of educational events provided more than 600
attendees with interactive workshops, personalized consultations and information to help them build a
stronger economic foundation. These events featured business leaders, infuencers and JPMorgan Chase
professionals who shared valuable insights and resources to help demystify wealth creation for the
communities that we serve and improve their fnancial strength.
CASE STUDY PROVIDING TOOLS TO GROW BLACK WEALTH
In July 2023, JPMorgan Chase’s ABP and the National Pan-Hellenic Council — composed of nine historically
Black fraternities and sororities known as the Divine 9 (“D9”) — announced a collaboration to support a
more diverse talent pool of business leaders and provide fnancial health and wealth-building tools. By the

ongoing eforts to help grow Black wealth.
CASE STUDY DEEPENING OUR COMMITMENT TO THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED
In May 2023, JPMorgan Chase joined members of the Veteran Jobs Mission (“VJM”) — a coalition which our
Firm co-founded in 2011, consisting largely of Fortune 500 companies representing nearly every sector in
the U.S. economy — to announce the creation of the Veteran Jobs Advisory Board. The Veteran Jobs
Advisory Board, which held their inaugural meeting in spring 2023 in Washington, D.C., is composed of 14
corporate leaders with backgrounds in military and veteran afairs, human resources, and DEI. The Veteran
Jobs Advisory Board will provide strategic direction and oversight of VJM as it continues to expand its
commitment to support economic opportunities for veterans and military spouses, including VJM’s goal to
hire two million veterans and 200,000 military spouses by 2032.
CASE STUDY CREATING PATHWAYS TO ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
JPMorgan Chase continued to advance economic opportunity for people with disabilities in 2023. Our Firm joined
lawmakers and business leaders in Washington, D.C. to show support for passage of the Supplemental Security
Income (“SSI”) Savings Penalty Elimination Act. Modernizing the program, by updating asset limits for the frst time
in nearly 40 years, would allow millions of people with disabilities who receive SSI benefts the opportunity to build
their savings without putting their essential benefts at risk.
In addition, we provided business coaching to more than 370 entrepreneurs and funding for the frst phase of the
Moonshot Disability Accelerator Initiative, which was launched by SmartJob, to close the disability wealth gap by
resourcing and supporting the next generation of inclusive technology start-ups. We also launched virtual and
accessible self-service capabilities with 2GetherInternational, through its joint pilot of the Online Venture Lab, which
automates business coaching for entrepreneurs with disabilities.

TRAINING
We seek to train our employees to provide them with the skills needed for
today and tomorrow. We prepare new employees for their roles with a series of
learning over their frst 90 days, and tenured employees continue to take both
voluntary and required training. Firmwide, employees are required to complete
training on topics such as culture and conduct, anti-money laundering, privacy
and data protection, cybersecurity, anti-discrimination, anti-harassment, and
anti-corruption. Employees have additional opportunities to enhance their
skills through training across a range of professional, business, digital, and
technology topics. In 2023, employees completed nearly 9.7 million courses or
over 7.4 million hours of training through self-paced learning as well as virtual
and traditional classrooms.
CASE STUDY U.S. EDUCATION BENEFIT PROGRAM
Through our U.S. Education Beneft Program, we further support
employee development by ofering funding for eligible employees for over
500 certifcate, associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s, executive education and
language learning programs, provided by a variety of global institutions.
These programs support employees in acquiring skills for the roles they are
in today, and prepare them to take on new opportunities at our Firm.
Of the approximately 11,600 employees who enrolled in our Education
Beneft Program in 2023, 80% were associate level and below – and since
the program launched in 2021, participants in entry-level positions have
been more likely to be promoted or experience career mobility compared
to peers that did not participate. Additionally, since the program launched,
nearly 51% of participants identifed as women, and 64% identifed as
ethnically diverse.
UPSKILLING AND RESKILLING PROGRAMS
Upskilling and reskilling our existing employees is an efective and efcient
way to have the talent we need to thrive now and into the future.
With rapid and continuous changes in technology, providing future-focused
learning that helps our employees advance their skills is important to our Firm’s
success. At the forefront of our upskilling and reskilling strategy is building
in-demand technology and data skills, such as software engineering, artifcial
intelligence and machine learning, cloud engineering, and data science.
In 2023, we trained approximately 2,200 entry-level Software Engineers as part
of our Global Software Engineering Program and launched a new Data Science
Analyst Program. More broadly, as part of our Global Technology Cloud Learning
Framework and Public Cloud Learning Journeys, over 55% of our Global
Technology employees now hold a certifcation in Cloud Learning Frameworks.
There has been a 210% year-over-year increase in our data skills courses taken
across our Firm, from approximately 40,000 courses completed in 2022 to
approximately 124,000 in 2023. Additionally, in 2023, we launched our frst
frmwide data learning event with approximately 50,000 registered participants.
In our Consumer & Community Banking business, we piloted a new micro-
learning tool for employees in Operations, which integrates real-time business
metrics with personalized learning, peer-to-peer recognition and coaching.
This platform empowers colleagues to improve their performance through
bite-sized learnings designed to reinforce the critical knowledge and skills
needed in their roles, as well as encourages leaders to coach, challenge, and
celebrate their teams. Following the success of this pilot in 2023, we are
looking for opportunities to scale and launch it more widely to provide
valuable tools to more employees.
LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT
Leadership Edge seeks to develop and inspire our world-class managers and
executives to drive a culture of inclusion, empowerment and growth so
employees can reach their full potential and deliver value for our Firm. The
Leadership Edge development curriculum is aligned to the eight capabilities
that we believe defne what it is to be an efective manager at our Firm. The
capabilities include building teams, driving performance, prioritizing DEI and
guiding careers. During 2023, approximately 24,400 managers and executives
participated in Leadership Edge initiatives, engaging through both
instructor-led programs and digital, self-paced content.
Our Firm's Employee Opinion Survey results indicated higher levels of
engagement between managers and their teams for managers that have
attended Leadership Edge programs, compared to managers yet to participate.
We also launched a new upward feedback survey for Managing Directors to help
improve the quality and consistency of feedback provided to senior leaders and
further support the development of their manager capabilities.
In 2023, we also continued to maintain a focus on our talent management and
succession planning process. Our Human Resources team actively engages
with senior leaders to discuss key talent, internal succession and the develop-
ment of our leadership pipeline.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS
We use an annual frmwide performance review process to help employees
grow. Employees are assessed on both results (“what”) and behaviors (“how”)
on four frmwide Performance Dimensions and expectations for their level:
Business Results; Client/Customer/Stakeholder; Teamwork and Leadership;
and Risks, Controls and Conduct.

organizations address opportunities and challenges in our communities. These programs include: Board Service, which has
successfully placed over 400 employees on nonproft boards, along with providing fnancial support; The Service Corps, which
leverages the talent and expertise of our employees to address the business needs of nonprofts and strengthen their ability to meet
community goals; and Tech for Social Good.
CASE STUDY LEGAL PRO BONO PROGRAM
Our Firm's support for skills-based volunteerism and service is exemplifed by the Legal Department's global pro bono program.
Regional networks of Legal Department employees organize and mobilize colleagues to participate in both in-person and virtual
events focused on providing free legal services in immigration, criminal justice, employment opportunities, education, housing
and human services, among other areas. Additionally, the Legal Department's unique Fellowship program provides one member

HEALTH & WELL-BEING PROGRAMS
We ofer healthcare benefts for employees and their families. Our
Firm continues to make signifcant investments in our U.S. Health &
Wellness plans, focusing on our key tenets of afordability, access,
choice and wellness. Additionally, we ofer market-consistent pensions
and health and welfare programs throughout our non-U.S. locations.
In an efort to make healthcare accessible, we set medical payroll
contributions and cost-sharing for U.S. employees on a sliding scale,
with lower costs for lower earners. Over the past two years, our Firm
has invested $170 million to enhance U.S. medical coverage, resulting
in lower deductibles, lower out-of-pocket maximums, lower
prescription drug costs, and lower payroll contributions for most
employees. We have also taken steps to make the costs of routine
care more predictable in the form of a fxed-dollar copayment for
common medical needs, as well as free preventative drugs such
as insulin.
We encourage our employees to focus on their well-being and make
healthy choices a priority. We provide a range of oferings, from free
fu shots and health screenings to a wide array of programs that help
those who want to manage their weight, quit smoking, and reduce
stress. We also ofer our employees access to a suite of tools to help
them improve their mental resilience and assess their fnancial
well-being. Many of these activities, as well as certain preventative
care actions, are incentivized for U.S. employees through our Medical
Reimbursement Accounts, which are funded by the Firm when
employees complete certain wellness activities. These accounts are
used to cover out-of-pocket medical and prescription drug expenses.
The Firm also works to foster a culture that encourages seeking and
obtaining mental healthcare. This includes reducing stigma, ofering
education and resources and providing access to afordable
high-quality mental healthcare. We talk openly about mental health
challenges at the Firm, as seen through a powerful collection of
more than 100 personal employee stories available on our employee
intranet. We also provide free mental health services and access to
on-site behavioral health clinicians at many of our large ofces.
CASE STUDY U.S. WELLNESS SCREENINGS & HEALTH EDUCATION SERIES
In the U.S., we ofer free biometric wellness screenings and online wellness
assessments to help identify health risks and enable employees to get
preventative care. In the most recent year, 22% of surveyed employees said the
screenings helped them discover a health risk previously unknown to them. In
2023, we held more than 550 on-site screening events at over 200 U.S. locations,
as well as ofered of-site options to make getting a screening convenient. More
than 73% of our U.S. employees completed both of these preventative
health activities.
In 2023, we also developed and launched a series of panel sessions focused on
raising awareness about common health conditions, particularly those that impact
certain demographic populations. Sessions featured clinical experts and employees
who shared their personal experiences on topics such as heart health, kidney
disease, infectious disease, diabetes, stroke, menopause and cancer. Approximately
25,000 employees across the globe registered for the nine events held, and more
than 55% of post-event survey respondents indicated that they planned to take
preventative care steps as a result of the information they received.

rising costs of the U.S. healthcare system. Morgan Health is investing $250
million of our Firm’s capital to scale promising companies focused on driving
greater accountability, outcomes and value in healthcare. Through the end of
2023, Morgan Health deployed $155 million in 6 early-stage companies: apree
health, Embold Health, Centivo, LetsGetChecked, Kindbody, and Personify
Health. Morgan Health aspires to be a model for other employers in driving
scalable, impactful and value-based employee healthcare solutions and
providing thought leadership.
Morgan Health seeks to bring greater accountability to healthcare by
supporting models designed to improve employees’ health outcomes, reduce
costs and fll gaps in the equity of care. Morgan Health’s approach is to deploy
new models for our employees based on relationships built with local
healthcare providers. For example, apree’s collaboration with Central Ohio
Primary Care ofers on- or near-site primary care designed to provide
employees in Columbus, OH with fexibility and options when it comes to
managing their overall health and wellness.
SUPPORTING OUR EMPLOYEES AND THEIR FAMILIES
Supporting working families is an important element of how we support our
employees at various life stages — starting with providing time away from
work for people to care for themselves or a member of their family. Our Firm
provides U.S.-based employees with paid sick leave each year, up to 96 hours
depending on local laws. We also provide most full-time and part-time
employees three to fve weeks of paid vacation annually. In 2023, we
enhanced paid time of for employees in the U.S. to handle personal and
family needs. This included expanded bereavement paid time of for loss of a
spouse/domestic partner or child, as well as four weeks of critical caregivers
paid time of to care for a seriously ill parent, child, or spouse/domestic
partner. Globally, we also enhanced parental leave to 16 weeks for parents
who have or adopt a child.
We also provide family-building assistance to help our U.S.-based employees
with the high costs of adoption, surrogacy and fertility expenses, including up
to $10,000 per child in eligible adoption expenses, up to a $30,000 lifetime
maximum for surrogacy and $40,000 lifetime maximum for eligible
fertility expenses.
Our Parents@jpmc program ofers educational sessions with parenting experts
and connects parents with a wide range of other programs ofered by our
Firm. For those with young children, we try to remove some of the stress
associated with fnding and paying for childcare by ofering access to
comprehensive childcare support. This includes access to on-site and near-site
childcare centers for full-service and back-up care needs in many large
locations. Through this program, we ofer support to employees caring for
elderly parents — they can access elder care referrals and management, and
health advocacy services to navigate insurance and medical issues.
Additionally, we ofer parents of older children advice and access to our addi-
tional programs. For example, we ofer a college coaching service that helps
guide families through important educational challenges — including applying
for, selecting, and paying for college through access to personalized assistance
and resources. This beneft is provided at no cost to U.S. benefts-eligible
employees who are parents of high school juniors and seniors. Through our
U.S. Virtual Tutoring program, parents of children ages 5–18 in the U.S. have
access to virtual tutoring for their children on a variety of academic topics.
FINANCIAL HEALTH
We believe that fnancial health is an important part of people’s overall well-
being, and we ofer a wide range of benefts and programs to help employees
build a fnancially secure future, including a 401(k) savings plan in the U.S.,
retirement plans and employee stock purchase opportunities, depending on
individual circumstances. We also ofer a variety of fnancial well-being

In the U.S., we ofer our employees access to unlimited one-on-one
fnancial coaching with a Certifed Financial Planner®, who can help guide
them on a range of fnancial matters and create a personalized action plan
to track progress toward goals over time. This program provides a
Financial Wellness Score™ to help inform action plan development, and

99% of what men were paid. In 2023, in the U.S., employees who self-identifed

classifcations were paid, as a group, on par with what White employees were
paid, taking into account factors such as an employee’s role, tenure, seniority and
geography. Pay equity reviews give us important insights, but they are just a
starting point. If we identify individuals with compensation that is less than
expected, we dig deeper. Where appropriate, we take action to address it. While
we are proud of the overall diversity of our workforce, we recognize that there is
lower representation among women and ethnically diverse employees,
particularly in senior management level positions. We are taking a variety of
actions focused on more broadly sourcing, recruiting, developing and advancing
the full breadth of available talent, including women and ethnically diverse talent.

Sustainable Bond Report
In 2022, we undertook a process to identify and assess which ESG topics are most pertinent to our business, operations
and stakeholders. In doing this work, we engaged with internal stakeholders and subject matter experts, and retained
the services of an external consultant. The foregoing process and identifcation of key ESG topics was undertaken for
the purposes of informing our ESG reporting; our inclusion of topics in this report is diferent from disclosures under
mandatory regulatory reporting, including under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regulations. While
this report describes events, including potential future events, that may be signifcant, any signifcance does not
necessarily equate to the level of materiality of disclosures required under law, including U.S. federal securities law.
To identify our key ESG topics, we undertook the following:
External research: including conducting a high-level review of key ESG trends that apply to the Firm and assessing
relevant topic areas identifed by voluntary ESG disclosure frameworks, ESG raters and rankers, and industry practice,
with the aim of identifying a list of potential ESG topics.
Engagement: with internal stakeholders and subject matter experts from across the Firm to evaluate the potential list
of ESG topics. We asked subject matter experts questions about what topics they view as important to the Firm and
its key stakeholders.
Evaluation: of insights gained from internal stakeholder engagement by analyzing fndings to prioritize topics. When
evaluating potential ESG topics, we also considered business-related metrics including operational costs, revenue,
regulation/compliance, reputation and strategy.
Our process in 2022 identifed the following as our key ESG topics:

Note on the Firm’s legal proceedings: JPMorgan Chase & Co. and/or its sub-
sidiaries (collectively, the "Firm") are defendants or putative defendants in
numerous legal proceedings, including private civil, litigations and regulatory/
government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions
involving a single plaintif to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of
class members and cover a wide range of issues. Investigations involve both
formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and
self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages
of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm's
lines of business and geographies and a wide variety of claims (including com-
mon law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and con-
sumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. Based
on current knowledge, the Firm believes it has asserted meritorious defenses
to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceed-
ings, intends to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. For further discus-

From time to time, JPMorgan Chase & Co. or its subsidiaries (collectively, “JPMorgan Chase” or “we”) may issue “Sustainable Bonds”.
Sustainable Bonds include green, social or sustainability bonds, which are issuances by JPMorgan Chase of debt securities for which
we undertake to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds of the issuance to fund “Eligible Green Projects”, “Eligible Social
Projects” (collectively, “Eligible Projects”) or both, as described by our Sustainable Bond Framework (October 2022) (the “October
2022 Framework”).
From the publication of our October 2022 Framework to November 30, 2023, JPMorgan Chase has issued one Sustainable Bond (one
benchmark issuance) for an aggregate total notional of $2 billion. We manage the allocation of these proceeds on a portfolio basis in
a single conceptual portfolio of assets, as described in our October 2022 Framework, which we refer to as the “Sustainable Asset
Portfolio”. Below, we detail the allocation of the aggregate net proceeds of outstanding Sustainable Bonds issued under our October
2022 Framework to Eligible Projects within our Sustainable Asset Portfolio, as well as expected impact metrics.
All data within this JPMorgan Chase Sustainable Bond Report is as of November 30, 2023 unless otherwise noted.
Prior to the publication of our October 2022 Framework, we issued three Sustainable Bonds
under our inaugural Sustainable Bond Framework (July 2020) (the “July 2020 Framework”).
As described in the July 2020 Framework, proceeds were managed on a bond-by-bond basis
and we reported allocation of proceeds for each of those bonds in our Green Bond Annual
Report (September 2021), Social Annual Bond Report (February 2022), and our Sustainable
Bond Annual Report included in our 2021 ESG Report. As an amount equal to the net
proceeds of these bonds has already been allocated, we do not report on these bonds again.

As described in our October 2022 Framework, an Eligible Project may be selected for inclusion in
the Sustainable Asset Portfolio for up to 24 months from JPMorgan Chase’s fnancing, investment
or disbursement of funds for that Eligible Project.
Once an Eligible Project has been selected for inclusion in the Sustainable Asset Portfolio, it will
remain part of the Sustainable Asset Portfolio unless or until the relevant project is in default, has
terminated, has been sold, is otherwise no longer outstanding or no longer meets the eligibility
criteria described in our Framework.
No guarantee can be made that assets will remain in the Sustainable Asset Portfolio until their
anticipated maturity.
CASE STUDY GREEN PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS
In December 2021, JPMorgan Chase provided $66.4 million74 of tax equity fnancing for Riverstart Solar Park, a
200-megawatt (MW) utility-scale solar park in Randolph County, Indiana. The project is owned and operated by EDP
Renewables North America (EDPR NA), a leading renewable energy developer and a top fve renewable energy operator in
the United States. Since coming online in 2022, Riverstart Solar Park has helped strengthen the energy security and local
economy of Randolph County and the state of Indiana by generating energy supply equivalent to the average consumption of
more than 38,000 Indiana homes annually; creating more than 500 jobs during its construction in 2021; and providing
income of approximately $5 million to local landowners from 2020 through 2023.
Management of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase”) asserts that, as of November 30, 2023 (i) the aggregate nominal
amount1 of all Eligible Projects included in the Sustainable Asset Portfolio2 meets or exceeds the aggregate net proceeds of
all outstanding Sustainable Bonds issued and (ii) the Eligible Projects included within the Sustainable Asset Portfolio meet
the eligibility criteria as referenced below.
For purposes of this assertion, (i) the aggregate nominal amount of all Eligible Projects included in the Sustainable Asset
Portfolio2 was $3,027 million as of November 30, 2023, and the net proceeds of all outstanding Sustainable Bonds issued
was $1,995 million3 and (ii) the Eligible Projects included in the Sustainable Asset Portfolio2 relate to the development,
construction, installation, operation or acquisition of 11 wind energy projects, 2 residential solar energy projects, and 22
utility solar energy projects4 for which JPMorgan Chase fnanced, invested, or disbursed funds from November 30, 2021 (24
months prior to the assertion date) to November 30, 2023.
1 The nominal amount represents the undiscounted cash funded amount of the asset (net of return of capital) as of November 30, 2023.
2 The Sustainable Asset Portfolio refers to a single conceptual portfolio of assets, as described in our Sustainable Bond Framework (October 2022).
3 Net proceeds of all outstanding Sustainable Bonds issued relate to the October 16, 2023, issuance of JPMorgan Chase ’s $2 billion Fixed-to-Floating Rate Notes due 2027.
4 See the ”Project Type” and “Number of Projects” columns within the table entitled “Renewable Energy Allocation of Net Proceeds and Expected Impact Metrics” contained in this Annual
Sustainable Bond Report. This Annual Sustainable Bond Report is included as an appendix to JPMorgan Chase ’s FY2023 Environmental, Social & Governance Report.
74 JPMorgan Chase provided additional funding of $44.5 million of tax equity in Riverstart Solar Park in September 2021, which is not included in the Sustainable Asset Portfolio.

Report of Independent Accountants
To the Management of JPMorgan Chase & Co.
We have examined the management assertion of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPMorgan Chase) contained in this Annual Sustainable Bond Report, that as
November 30, 2023 (i) the aggregate nominal amount of all Eligible Projects included in the Sustainable Asset Portfolio meets or exceeds the aggregate
net proceeds of all outstanding Sustainable Bonds issued and (ii) the Eligible Projects included within the Sustainable Asset Portfolio meet the eligibility
criteria, as further described in management’s assertion. JPMorgan Chase’s management is responsible for its assertion. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assertion based on our examination.
Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management's assertion is fairly stated,
in all material respects. An examination involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about management’s assertion. The nature, timing, and extent
of the procedures selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of management’s assertion, whether
due to fraud or error. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements related to the
engagement.
Only the information included in the “Project Type” and “Number of Projects” columns and the $3,027 million in the “Allocated” column within the
table entitled “Renewable Energy Allocation of Net Proceeds and Expected Impact Metrics” contained in this Annual Sustainable Bond Report is part
of JPMorgan Chase’s management assertion and our examination engagement. This Annual Sustainable Bond Report is included as an appendix to
JPMorgan Chase’s FY2023 Environmental, Social & Governance Report (ESG Report). The other information in this Annual Sustainable Bond Report and
JPMorgan Chase’s ESG Report have not been subjected to the procedures applied in our examination engagement, and accordingly, we make no comment
as to its completeness and accuracy and do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on such information.
