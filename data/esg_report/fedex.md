Sustainable growth and one FedEx
In June 2024, we completed our planned consolidation
of operating companies under a new structure that
will bring even greater flexibility, efficiency, and
intelligence to our business. This transformation to
one FedEx created a single company operating a
unified, fully integrated air-ground express network
under the respected FedEx brand. This transition
complements our ongoing efforts to optimize our
network, including Network 2.0 and Tricolor, which are
designed to improve the efficiency of our parcel and
freight pickup-and-delivery (PUD) operations and air
network. Additionally, FedEx Freight provides lessthan-truckload freight transportation services.
In December 2024, we announced our intention to
spin FedEx Freight off from our portfolio structure
through the creation of a second, distinct, industryleading publicly traded company.
We recognize the business case for responsible
growth, including how a strong governance program
focused on environmental and social strategies can
enhance risk management, drive cost savings, provide
opportunities for our global workforce, and support
long-term value creation. Our transition to one FedEx
will unlock new value for our customers, enable
opportunity, and foster a more unified, inclusive
culture for our team members. By leveraging the
strengths of our services, we seek to create an end-toend streamlined network that enables efficiency while
simultaneously maximizing returns for stockholders.
To prepare for forthcoming mandatory disclosures
required by international, national, and sub-national
governing bodies that oversee the areas in which
we operate, we established cross-functional teams
whose work is overseen by the Board of Director’s
Audit and Finance and Governance, Safety, and Public
Policy Committees.
Our commitment to deliver a more sustainable
future also builds on the foundation of our PeopleService-Profit philosophy, which empowers our team
members, customers, and communities to create
positive, far-reaching effects worldwide.
FedEx 2025 Corporate Responsibility Report 4

President and CEO
Letter from the CEO
One central question drives us at FedEx:
How can we deliver greater value?
We define value by progress, considering not only
our daily contributions but also how we advance
the world. As the company that pioneered express
delivery and built the network that connects the
globe, we understand that progress is only possible
through change.
That is why we continuously innovate and pursue
what’s next to deliver greater value and a brighter
future for the people and communities we serve and
the planet we share.
This ambition is reflected in our vision to revolutionize
commerce by leveraging data and AI to digitize global
supply chains, making them smarter, more efficient,
resilient, and sustainable for everyone.
As supply chains evolve in real time, we see significant
value in moving commerce from reactive and uncertain
to proactive and predictive, fostering an interconnected
ecosystem strengthened by data and technology.
Our principles—Leading with integrity
To deliver value, we embody our cultural values. As we
reinvent supply chains for the future, one thing remains
constant: our unwavering commitment to safety, ethical
decision-making, and compliance in everything we do.
I’m proud that FedEx is consistently recognized as
one of the most ethical companies in the world. Every
day, our team members deliver our Purple Promise—
to make every FedEx experience outstanding—
responsibly, respectfully, and with integrity.
To advance these principles, we established a
global AI governance team this year to manage
risks and promote responsible use. And in our
recent materiality assessment, we aligned our
priorities with the topics that are most important
to our stakeholders and the ongoing success of
our business.
Our planet—Sensing opportunity,
pursuing it responsibly
One area of importance to all our stakeholders is the
health of our planet and communities worldwide.
Our efforts to create a more efficient and profitable
network align with our sustainability strategy as we
reduce overlapping inefficiencies and deliver value for
our stakeholders.
We set an ambitious goal of becoming carbon-neutral
across our operations by 2040. We’re using cuttingedge technologies to enhance the efficiency of our
network and facilities, modernize and electrify our
fleets, and harness alternative sources of energy.
These initiatives and more have helped us reduce our
aviation emissions intensity by 30% from our 2005
baseline. We are taking this further by targeting a
40% reduction in aviation emissions intensity by
2034, also based on a 2005 baseline.
Network 2.0 is one of the largest efficiency initiatives
we have undertaken in our 52-year history. Now in
the third year of integrating our legacy express and
ground networks in North America, we have optimized
over 300 locations, giving us the opportunity to reduce
our carbon footprint, streamline routes, lower our
cost to serve, and enhance connectivity across our
operations and teams.
We will continue to explore innovative ways to
optimize our network, reduce our environmental
impact, and run our business more intelligently,
sustainably, and responsibly.
Our people—One team with one vision
Our more than 500,000 global employees are the
heart of the FedEx ecosystem and the driving force
behind our mission to deliver value.
One groundbreaking result of our collaborative,
innovation-first culture is fdx—a pioneering
e-commerce platform that leverages powerful
FedEx network insights to help businesses optimize
their supply chains—from streamlining fulfillment
with near real-time shipping analytics to enhancing
sustainability through carbon emissions data.
Innovations of this nature demand teamwork,
determination, and expertise. We will continue to
make significant investments to attract, reward, and
nurture top talent while fostering a team that reflects
the world we serve, the customers we collaborate
with, and the communities in which we live and work.
A vision with value
For over fifty years, FedEx has helped move the world
forward. We remain dedicated to making it better and
brighter for all.
Our vision to make supply chains smarter for
everyone amplifies our fundamental strengths—our
unmatched global network, our legacy of innovation,
and our renowned culture—to advance growth and
progress now and in the future.
Throughout our history, FedEx has never waited for
change; we create it. This spirit drives us to usher
in a new era of global commerce—one enhanced
by technology, defined through collaboration, and
shaped with a steadfast commitment to delivering
greater value in the world.

OUR PRINCIPLES OUR PRINCIPLES
DELIVERING ON STAKEHOLDER EXPECTATIONS
Governance structure
At FedEx, we understand that integrating corporate
responsibility principles into our company’s strategic
focus is essential to mitigating business risks,
enhancing long-term financial performance, and
delivering positive value for our business, customers,
team members, and stockholders. These principles are
woven into every component of the FedEx culture—
from efficient resource management to connected
support for all our team members, to the highest
standards of business conduct. To help ensure these
principles are part of our everyday operations, we align
our sustainability approach with our mission, values,
and long-term strategy.
The FedEx Board of Directors and its committees
oversee enterprise corporate responsibility initiatives
and programs, including reviewing and guiding our
sustainability strategy, supervising corporate target
setting, and monitoring progress towards our goals.
Our Board also provides oversight of environmental
risks, including climate change. Further, our Chief
Sustainability Officer (CSO) provides updates to
the Governance, Safety, and Public Policy and Audit
and Finance Committees of the Board in addition to
developing, implementing, and managing our overall
sustainability strategy and initiatives.
Our Board of Directors works to uphold the highest
quality of corporate governance. The Board seeks
in its members a blend of personal and professional
experiences, perspectives, and backgrounds, as well
as institutional knowledge and personal chemistry,
resulting in a high-performing Board that provides
sound and prudent guidance with respect to all of
the company’s operations and interests.
Our sustainability strategy aims to drive efficiency
and opportunity. See the Our planet and Our people
sections for more details on our environmental and
social governance approaches.

FedEx 2025 Corporate Responsibility Report 6
The Board has four standing committees comprised
entirely of independent members, each entrusted with
oversight of specific corporate responsibility aspects.
 The Governance, Safety, and Public Policy
Committee actively oversees our sustainability
goals, strategies, programs, and disclosures, and
management of our sustainability- and climaterelated risks. This committee is also responsible
for reviewing and discussing with management
our safety strategies, policies, programs, and
practices, and steps taken by management to
identify, assess, and manage risks relating to the
company’s political activities and expenditures.
 The Compensation and Human Resources
Committee reviews and discusses with our
management team key human resource
management strategies and programs.
 The Audit and Finance Committee is responsible
for oversight of the implementation and
effectiveness of the company’s corporate
integrity and compliance programs. Furthermore,
it holds regular discussions with management on
sustainability reporting and disclosures, including
aligning financial reporting with sustainability
disclosures, as well as internal controls and
procedures related to those disclosures.
 The Cyber and Technology Oversight
Committee reviews and discusses with
management the company’s cyber and
technology-related risks, including network
security, information and digital security,
data privacy and protection, and risks related
to emerging technologies such as artificial
intelligence (AI) and machine learning. The
committee also reviews aspects of the
company’s business continuity and disaster
recovery capabilities and contingency plans.
In 2024, the Board and its committees oversaw key
sustainable growth priorities, including upholding
our commitment to safety and our People-ServiceProfit cultural principles and values during the
one FedEx transition. Our Audit and Finance and
Governance, Safety, and Public Policy Committees
have reviewed this report and discussed its contents
with management.

Risk management
and materiality
Sustainable growth and risk management
Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program
establishes a unified framework for supporting
consistency in the identification, reporting, and
management of key risks across our business
and value chain. Annually, we determine our core
business risks through analysis of industry research,
stakeholder engagement, surveys, and workshops and
direct consultation with senior leadership. We classify
risks into five groups—External, Strategic, Operational,
Financial, and Technology—and prioritize them
based on potential financial effects, the likelihood of
occurrence within the next fiscal year, and the level of
current controls in place to manage those risks.
The Enterprise Risk Council then meets to review the
risk assessment results and validate top enterprise
risks and emerging trends. Key enterprise risks are
discussed with the Board and the Audit and Finance
Committee at least annually, and any significant
changes to these risks are reported to the Board and
the Audit and Finance Committee. We embed short-,
medium-, and long-term risk management into our
strategic financial planning process and business
decision-making.
FedEx also evaluates climate-change-related
risks and opportunities as part of our annual
assessment process. These include the potential
for severe weather disruption, regulatory changes,
and reputational risks as public awareness grows
around the environmental impacts of our industry.
We address these risks through proactive public
policy and external stakeholder engagement and
by closely monitoring global social perspectives,
geopolitical issues, and regulatory developments.
We also implement a strategic approach to minimize
the environmental impact of our operations as we work
toward carbon-neutral operations. See the Facilities
section for more details on our resiliency efforts.
Material topics and double
materiality approach
FedEx conducts regular materiality assessments to
help prioritize sustainable growth topics that are most
important to our business and stakeholders. In FY24,
we refreshed our assessment, which was informed by
voluntary and regulatory reporting frameworks, including
the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS).
Our double materiality assessment considered both
the impacts our operations have on people and the
environment (impact materiality) and how sustainability
matters affect our development, performance, and
financial position (financial materiality). We expect to
refresh these results on an annual basis.
During the assessment, we conducted desktop
research, consulted internal stakeholders, and
engaged external stakeholders to identify, evaluate,
and prioritize related impacts, risks, and opportunities
(IROs) across our value chain. Engaging key
stakeholders enabled us to help ensure the list of
IROs was complete and accurate, the assessment of
IROs was appropriate, and the conclusions reached
were reasonable. Through this double materiality
assessment, we are best able to understand
our impacts, proactively mitigate risks, pursue
opportunities, and manage key topics relevant to
our global business and value chain.
The results reconfirmed our continued efforts to
focus on areas such as climate change, energy use,
working conditions, business conduct, and effective
management of supplier relationships. We look forward
to leveraging learnings from this process to enhance
upcoming assessments and our strategy.

Corporate integrity
and compliance
Our commitment to integrity and compliance fosters
trust and reliability with our customers, team members,
and the communities we serve. The Corporate
Integrity and Compliance department, led by our Chief
Compliance Officer, oversees our ethics and compliance
programs and works with stakeholders inside and
outside the enterprise to help ensure operations are
conducted with integrity. We implement a risk-based
approach to prevent, identify, and mitigate compliance
risks common within the transportation and logistics
sector as well as risks unique to FedEx. We routinely
review and update our policies and programs to align
with global standards and emerging regulations.
Ethisphere recognized FedEx as one
of the 2025 World’s Most Ethical
Companies®, our third consecutive
year achieving this accomplishment
36
languages offered for
risk-based compliance training
to all employees worldwide
within our operations. We provide fair wages, comply
with applicable wage-and-hour laws in the areas
where we operate, and require all team members
to communicate any suspected violations of human
rights. We also do not tolerate discrimination,
harassment, violence, or bullying based on any
characteristic protected under national, state, or
local laws. We hold our third-party contractors and
suppliers to these same standards.
We provide a comprehensive set of compliance
resources on our Corporate Integrity and
Compliance website, including global policies,
guidelines, and resources.
Integrity and compliance
education and training
FedEx is one of the world’s most trusted and
admired companies because of the dedication
of our team members. We provide employees
with accessible and clear ethics and compliance
education to mitigate potential risks and deter
non-compliance. Our Corporate Integrity and
Compliance department oversees these trainings
to ensure they are accurate, effective, up-to-date,
and accessible to all employees across the globe.
These trainings cover topics such as anti-corruption,
antitrust, conflicts of interest, and data privacy, as
well as compliance behaviors and responsibilities
related to our culture values, the Code, and
compliance policies.
In 2025, we updated our Code training course, which
covers essential integrity and compliance policies and
incorporates key themes such as respect, trust, legal
compliance, raising concerns, and non-retaliation.
In the spring of 2025, we expanded our established
program of holding regional and subsidiary
Compliance Week events and held our first annual
enterprise-wide global Compliance Week, which
offered live, interactive risk-mitigation education
through a virtual conference platform.
FedEx Code of Conduct and
global compliance policies
Our FedEx Code of Conduct (Code) publicly states
our stance on ethics and compliance and reminds
us why reliability and trust are important to our
company, customers, and stakeholders. The Code
outlines the legal, ethical, and behavioral expectations
we mandate for all team members to uphold across
our global operations. The Code applies to all FedEx
officers, directors, managers, and employees. It also
applies to members of the FedEx Board of Directors
when acting in their roles as Board members or
in any other capacities related to FedEx. Certain
sections also apply to third parties providing
services on behalf of FedEx.
In 2024, we developed a stand-alone Human Rights
Policy to reinforce our commitment to protecting
and advancing human rights across our global
operations and value chain. We have zero tolerance
for the use of illegal child, compulsory, or forced labor
and strictly prohibit human slavery and trafficking
Guided by a strategic communication plan, our team
communicates elements of our Code and compliance
principles through regular, enterprise-wide emails,
newsletters, videos, and digital signage. We provide
FedEx managers with a compliance toolkit, which
includes resources like our Ethical Leadership Guide,
to communicate best ethics practices to their teams.
Every year, we administer a Code of Conduct
Questionnaire for officers, directors, and senior
managers to gauge their awareness of and
compliance with the Code. We also conduct a
comprehensive, company-wide integrity survey for
all employees every other year. This survey helps
us evaluate the effectiveness of our compliance
program and highlights where we may adjust our
approach as needed.

Cybersecurity and data privacy
It is essential for FedEx to secure our digital
environments against threats to uphold the trust
of our stakeholders and enable business continuity.
The Board’s Cyber and Technology Oversight
Committee routinely reviews and discusses with
management our cyber- and technology-related
risks. Our Information Security (InfoSec) team
audits our projects to assess information security
compliance while our Global Privacy Office evaluates
compliance of FedEx practices and policies with
relevant privacy regulations. Additionally, our Internal
Audit team regularly assesses the effectiveness
of our information security and privacy controls
and programs.
Responsible use of AI
FedEx is committed to the responsible use of
generative AI to help drive workplace efficiencies.
In FY24, we created a global AI governance team to
manage risks and monitor compliance with relevant
regulations. The Cyber and Technology Oversight
Committee reviews and discusses with management
the incorporation of AI into our operations, services,
and strategies, along with related risks.
In FY24, we implemented an enterprise-wide AI policy
that defines principles, applicable regulations, and
internal roles to promote the ethical and lawful use
of generative AI. Using these guidelines, our Data
Privacy and Legal teams work with InfoSec and FedEx
Dataworks to manage AI requests. With support
from FedEx Dataworks, our teams also use a secure,
internal AI tool, GenAIHub, for operational process
efficiencies and to create accessible applications for
team members across the enterprise. We are working
to create a unified data enablement team to make
data collection consistent and accessible across our
operations. We continue to review and update our
policies to align with emerging regulations, and we
implemented additional measures to support our
mandatory compliance program in FY25.
Cybersecurity and data privacy
education and training
To best equip our team members for responding to
threats, we conduct annual mandatory information
security, data privacy, and incident reporting training.
We also periodically organize online safety training
exercises focused on phishing education and strong
password and coding practices.
We extend our cybersecurity and data privacy
trainings to business partners and affinity groups,
such as the FedEx Culture Ambassadors and
Cybersecurity Champions. Additionally, our FedEx
Trust Center website provides customers with
guidance on how we safeguard their privacy and
how to facilitate personal data requests.

In FY24, we revised our data privacy training to
incorporate a risk-based data breach module, including
steps on how to properly identify and report a data
breach. We also updated our personal data incident
response procedures to better delineate roles and
responsibilities of internal stakeholders, align incident
response processes between various stakeholder
incident response playbooks, and streamline reporting
incidents to proper regulatory bodies.
We conducted multiple cybersecurity simulations in
FY24, ranging from high-impact ransomware events to
contained data breach events. Members of the Cyber
and Technology Oversight Committee participated
in one of these simulations. The worldwide FedEx
Information Security Management System has earned
the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) and International Electrotechnical Commission
(IEC) 27001:2022 Information Security Management
certification, demonstrating our continued commitment
to top-tier information security practices.
FedEx 2025 Corporate Responsibility Report 11
Small Business
Grants Program
We launched our Small Business
Grants Program in 2012 to recognize
innovative entrepreneurs and provide
funding to help accelerate their growth.
Since then, FedEx has offered versions
of the program in the U.S., Canada,
Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC),
Europe, and Asia-Pacific (APAC). In
FY24, we awarded $230,000 in prizes
to 10 small businesses in the U.S. The
program has since been retired.
Public policy and advocacy
FedEx actively participates in the political process
with the goal of promoting and protecting the
economic future of our customers, team members,
investors, and businesses. The Board’s Governance,
Safety, and Public Policy Committee oversees our
political activities and expenditures.
The Government and Regulatory Affairs department,
which reports directly to our Executive Vice President,
General Counsel, and Secretary, evaluates global
public policies and political and legislative trends to
identify potential risks and opportunities. Through
annual collaboration with senior business leaders, this
department establishes action plans and strategies
that align with our long-term priorities.
Globally, our Government and Regulatory Affairs
department supports public policies that foster free
trade by reducing barriers to trade between countries
and territories, and within the transportation
industry. Through this lens, we advocate for policies
specifically related to workforce development,
information security, tax, aviation, autonomous
delivery technology expansion, truck decarbonization
regulations, electric vehicle (EV) charging
infrastructure, and alternative and sustainable
aviation fuels.
The Government and Regulatory Affairs department
also oversees direct and indirect political spending
and engages with trade associations and taxexempt organizations. Through these engagements,
we have the potential to increase financial
performance, strengthen stockholder value,
and support the best interests of our employees.
We prioritize engagement on policy issues with
long-term significance to FedEx and alignment to
our corporate values, noting that participation as a
member of various trade associations comes with
the understanding that we may not always agree
with every position of the organization or other
members of the organization. See our Policy on
Political Contributions and Public Policy and Advocacy
webpage for more details on FedEx activities,
including our engagements with policymakers and
trade associations.
Climate advocacy
We support pragmatic and well-designed policies
that result in a more sustainable future for the
transportation and logistics industry. We work
towards effective climate policy by lobbying with
various government and industry organizations
and directly engaging with policymakers in support
of our carbon-neutral operations goal. Through
these efforts, we hope to help create innovative and
sustainable solutions within the transportation sector.

Supply chain
We rely on a network of approximately
100,000 direct suppliers to maintain our global
operations—90% of which are small- and mediumsized businesses. We manage and mitigate critical
risks in our supply chain by implementing robust
policies and governance processes, which are
overseen by our FedEx Supplier Management team.
The purchases FedEx makes from suppliers stimulate
follow-on business activity across national and
local economies, including each vendor’s revenues,
employment, taxes, and capital investments.
FedEx indirect contributions to total worldwide net
economic output reached an estimated $39 billion in
FY24, a 10% increase over our indirect contributions
in FY23, according to analysis from Dun & Bradstreet.
Additionally, this analysis showed that in 2023, FedEx
supported an estimated 730,000 jobs at our supplier
companies, including approximately 400,000 small
business jobs.
Supplier Code of Conduct
We strive to uphold appropriate working conditions
throughout our supply chain. The FedEx Supplier
Code of Conduct outlines the specific expectations
and guidelines we have for our suppliers, and
acknowledgement of these principles is included
in key managed supplier contracts. We expect all
suppliers to commit to the principles and standards
included in the Supplier Code.

helped provide $600,000 to 60 small businesses
owned by military veterans and/or entrepreneurs
with disabilities. Small business leaders are also
invited to participate in the FedEx Boost Camp for
monthly coaching, workshops, and mentoring.
Sustainability integration in our supply chain
Throughout our procurement process, FedEx screens
key managed suppliers against our standards for
environmental and social sustainability. We work
closely with our suppliers and internal stakeholders to
advance our corporate responsibility goals throughout
the value chain, focusing on sustainability. For example,
we are investigating opportunities to engage with
priority suppliers to develop sustainability action plans.
Further, the transition to one FedEx enables us to align
our sustainable sourcing metrics and goals across the
enterprise to broaden our impact.
We are founding members of the Sustainable
Purchasing Leadership Council and continue to be an
active member of their Strategic Advisory Committee.
We follow ISO 20400 guidance for corporateresponsibility-related metrics surrounding our
sourcing practices across the enterprise and regularly
request information from key managed suppliers to
understand and plan for potential sourcing risks.
Support for small businesses
Sourcing from small suppliers increases the resiliency
of our supply chain and enables us to better serve our
customers. The extensive FedEx network is a vital part
of the global supply chain for small businesses and a key
distribution network for these companies. At the same
time, we directly enable small business suppliers to grow
their own operations through our annual spending.
Small businesses also fuel economic growth and are
essential to the overall health and financial well-being
of communities. Through FedEx Cares, we empower
entrepreneurs from all backgrounds with the training,
connections, and capital they need to compete in the
global marketplace.

Just transition
Our goal of achieving carbon-neutral operations
and our overall climate change strategy offer
significant opportunities for creating value for
our stakeholders. The innovative solutions we are
developing have the potential to generate ongoing
employment opportunities, enhance our customers’
environmental performance, and improve living
standards in the communities where we operate.
However, we are aware of the potential challenges
we may face on this journey and in the broader
transition to a low-carbon economy.
FedEx recognizes the importance of a just
transition and seeks to ensure the benefits of
a low-carbon economy are shared across all the
communities in which we operate. Our purpose
is to connect people and possibilities; therefore, it
is essential we work with multiple stakeholders to
co-create and scale the most promising climate
solutions. We support the just transition within
our own operations by communicating with and
offering our employees comprehensive benefits
and providing trainings on necessary skills for a
lower-emissions world, such as driving EVs. See
the Our people section for more information.
FedEx has a history of community engagement and
stewardship through FedEx Cares. We collaborate
with local communities, non-governmental
organizations, and conservation leaders to
accelerate sustainable solutions, serving a wide
range of stakeholders. See the Our planet section
for more information on this engagement and
stewardship. We highly value consistent and robust
dialogue with those affected by the low-carbon
transition and seek to balance the interests of a
wide range of internal and external stakeholders.
While there are persistent challenges associated
with the transition to a low-carbon economy, we
believe our efforts have the potential to make a
positive change.

Karen Blanks Ellis
Chief Sustainability Officer and Vice President,
Environmental Affairs
Letter from the CSO
Effective sustainability leadership is guided in equal
parts by the past, the present, and the potential of the
business. FedEx has long understood the correlation
between the reduction of our environmental
impact and strong business practices—well before
sustainability became a business imperative for
companies across sectors and geographies. I am
fortunate as the company’s second chief sustainability
officer to stand on the strong foundation established
by my predecessor, Mitch Jackson, and build upon the
environmental milestones we’ve achieved.
This report highlights advances across our business,
demonstrating continued progress toward our
2040 goal of carbon-neutral operations, focused
on our operations accounting for 86% of our
overall emissions footprint. In FY24, we saw a 6.1%
year-over-year (FY23 to FY24) reduction in Scope
1 emissions. In aviation specifically, our Scope 1
emissions from jet fuel consumption decreased by
4.9% year-over-year, largely stemming from our
air operations efficiency initiatives, including our
fleet modernization program.
While taking a moment to acknowledge these
accomplishments, we also see a challenging road
stretching ahead of our goal of carbon neutral global
operations by 2040. Take, for instance, the market for
sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). In 2025, we began to
take delivery of over three million gallons of blended
SAF at the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).
While this agreement marks a positive step forward
towards our alternative aviation fuel procurement
goal, the fact that less than 1% of all jet fuel produced
in 2024 was SAF also reminds us of the market’s
limitations and the incomplete solutions available for
aviation emissions.
Our strategy to “decarbonize what’s possible, co-create
with purpose, and neutralize what’s left” accentuates
the inevitability that, even after prioritizing operational
emissions reductions, our industry will not have all the
solutions needed to eliminate emissions in their entirety.
This reality is why FedEx is vocal about the need for
high-integrity carbon credits in both voluntary and
regulated markets. Our support of the Yale Center
for Natural Carbon Capture enables world-class
scientists to research and deploy durable carbon
removal techniques that harness the Earth’s existing
processes. Already within four years of the Center’s
founding, these nature-based solutions—with their
co-benefits for communities and project stakeholders,
such as farmers—are attracting additional research
dollars, interest from policymakers, and investment from
private sector actors that want to be confident that
credits substantiate carbon being removed from the
atmosphere for the long term.
A new chapter in the history of FedEx is currently
unfolding, anchored in a vision of making supply chains
smarter for everyone. In parallel, we face an evolving
regulatory landscape, including new mandatory reporting
requirements and opportunities to continue enhancing
the information we disclose. This year, we were able
to expand our emissions inventory with supplemental
quality data, which contributes to the increase in our
reported Scope 3 emissions year-over-year.
Amid all these changes, one thing is certain whether you
are reading this report as a FedEx investor, customer,
team member, or other key stakeholder: you have our
team’s commitment to continue being transparent,
innovative, and diligent in our pursuit of solutions that
enable the sustainability of both our business and planet.

Strategic approach
to climate change
We play a crucial role in connecting people with
possibilities across the globe, and doing so efficiently
can drive cost savings, unlock new opportunities, and
secure long-term sustainable growth. Connecting the
world’s economies is also resource intensive, and the
impacts our operations generate contribute to climate
change through the emission of greenhouse gases.
In 2021, we set an ambitious goal to achieve
carbon-neutral operations by 2040 across our
global operations’ Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions
and our gross Scope 3 contracted transportation
emissions. We also set interim targets across our
main decarbonization levers including: parcel PUD
EV purchases, aviation fleet emissions intensity and
fleet retirement, and sustainable energy and fuel
procurement to help us progress toward our carbonneutral operations target.
Our strategic approach to achieving carbon-neutral
operations by 2040 is built on three principles:
1) Decarbonize what’s possible, 2) Co-create with
purpose, and 3) Neutralize what’s left. Our strategy
guides us as we implement comprehensive,
long-term actions and interim goals to achieve
carbon neutrality in our own operations, as well as
support the low-carbon transition of the broader
transportation and logistics industry.

Network optimization
Efficiency has always been at the heart
of every delivery we make. Our transition
to Network 2.0 is one of the largest
efficiency efforts we’ve undertaken in our
more than 50 years of serving customers.
By merging our two largest operating
companies, we are now redesigning our
ground network through Network 2.0.
This effort is designed to reduce our
station footprint, increase PUD route
efficiency, and optimize our enterprise
linehaul networks. Additionally, Tricolor,
the fundamental redesign of our
air network announced in FY24, is
enhancing the efficiency of the FedEx
air network. We expect operational
efficiencies realized from our transition
to enable us to continue reducing our
carbon footprint in the future.
ADVANCING FEDEX
Decarbonize what’s possible
As we strive to achieve our 2040 goal, we are
first focusing on decarbonizing our operations by
deploying proven technologies that reduce emissions,
as well as continuing our long-standing efficiency
programs. These efforts have a significant impact on
our overall emissions, driving a 6.1% reduction in our
Scope 1 emissions in FY24. They also enabled us to
achieve our goal of a 30% reduction in our aircraft
emissions intensity compared to a 2005 baseline. See
the Air operations section for more details on our
efforts to achieve this goal.
As our business continues to grow, our
decarbonization efforts have driven year-over-year
improvement in emissions intensity on a revenue
basis. This means we have been able to decouple
our business growth from our environmental
impact. Overall, we reduced our Scope 1 and 2
CO2e emissions intensity on a revenue basis by 58%
between FY09 and FY24, while our daily package
volume grew by an average of 121%.
Co-create with purpose
We recognize there are still sizeable gaps in the
technology needed to effectively address climate
change. Together with government agencies,
nonprofits, industry partners, and technology
innovators, we aim to co-create new solutions to help
our business and our industry address these gaps.
For example, FedEx has a long history of working with
original equipment manufacturers to ensure vehicles
are designed to meet the needs of our network. As
we implement Network 2.0, we aim to use fewer,
larger vehicles to drive greater efficiency along our
routes. This year, we participated in a pilot with the
Shyft Group, testing Blue Arc electric trucks on lastmile delivery routes in Memphis. The goal was to test
a vehicle with a much larger cargo capacity than the
majority of commercial EVs currently in market. This
pilot allowed our engineers to put new technology
to the test in real-life, strenuous situations, including
eight- to ten-hour routes. This experience enables
us to collaborate, provide feedback, and share our
expertise and marks a major milestone in the vehicle’s
readiness for widespread commercial use.

Neutralize what’s left We understand that reduction alone will not
be enough to reach our goal of carbon-neutral
oper
ations. In the latter part of the next decade, we
will need to offset remaining emissions that cannot
be fully reduced through technological inno
v
ations,
particularly those associa
ted with our air oper
ations.
Anticipating future needs, in 2021, we committed
$100 million to establish the Yale Cen
ter for Natural
Carbon Capture, empo
wering Yale scientists to
rapidly advance r
esearch on natur
e-based, durable
carbon dioxide remo
val (CDR) solutions. We belie
ve
that supporting a robust pipeline of solutions via
the Cen
ter will help add future supply of carbon
credits that are measurable, verifiable, and durable to both the compliance and voluntary marketplace.
Already, Yale faculty and gradua
t
es are serving
important roles with CDR start-ups, project registries,
go
vernment and non-go
vernmental organiz
ations,
and r
esearch institutions worldwide.
One of the most promising solutions for scalable
CDR is enhanced weathering, which in

y, Yale scientists are advising enhanced
weathering agricultural project de

to measure and scale their projects, including Lithos,
Silica, and Mati Carbon, and exploring how enhanced weathering can be integrated into industrial and
agricultural proc

Enhancing footprint data collection
2025 marks our 18th year of disclosing our emissions
in line with the GHG Pr

Aircraft fleet modernization
Modernizing our fleet of more than 700 aircraft has
been central to the significant progress we’ve made
in reducing the impact of our air fleet. It minimizes
GHG and other air emissions, improves fuel efficiency,
reduces local noise pollution, lowers operational costs,
and enhances network reliability. In FY24, we saved
130 million gallons of jet fuel and prevented over 1.2
million metric tons of CO2e emissions through our
aircraft modernization initiatives—equivalent to about
$370 million in savings.
In FY24, we reduced our Boeing 757F fleet from 115 to
92 aircraft. Our goal is to complete the third and final
phase of our three-engine aircraft retirements in 2032.
Looking ahead, we plan to take delivery of two Boeing
777F, 14 Boeing 767F, 10 ATR-72 600F, and 27 Cessna
408 aircraft between FY25 and FY26. In March 2025,
we agreed to purchase eight new Boeing 777F aircraft,
which will be phased in between FY26 and FY27. The
integration of this new equipment will reduce our
emissions per package-mile and shorten feeder routes.
FedEx Fuel Sense
Since the inception of the FedEx Fuel Sense program
in 2006, we have implemented 70 fuel-saving projects
and achieved an overall savings of 983 million gallons
of jet fuel. This is equivalent to avoiding 9.6 million
metric tons of CO2e. In FY24 alone, we saved 11.1
million gallons of jet fuel—equivalent to a cost savings
of over $30 million.
As part of the Fuel Sense program, our Vertical
Optimization initiative decreases fuel consumption by
flying our fleet at higher altitudes, where low air density
requires aircraft to expend less energy to propel forward.
Additionally, our new Flight Optimization initiative
provides fuel savings through real time route adjustments
which consider fuel burn, arrival calculations, winds,
weather, air space restrictions, and traffic conflicts. We
also introduced an automated fuel-tracking system that
uses innovative technology to replace paper fuel slips
and streamline our fueling process. In FY24, these three
initiatives alone saved 1.5 million gallons of jet fuel.
Sustainable aviation fuel
As we look to the future, SAF is a critical lever for further
emissions reductions within our operations. In 2025,
we began to take delivery of over three million gallons
of blended SAF in our U.S. operations. In addition, we
comply with SAF mandates in different regions around
the world. To meet our goal of procuring 30% of jet
fuel from a blend of alternative sources by 2030, we
will actively work to help improve the world’s supply of
SAF, which is not nearly at the scale needed to meet the
demands of the aviation sector.
We will continue to engage with industry, academia,
non-governmental organizations, and governments
to address this gap. We are also members of the First
Movers Coalition Aviation Sector working group to help
advocate for increased production and signal market
demand for emissions-reducing fuel technologies
in the industry. Additionally, we are members of the
International Air Transport Association’s SAF registry.

Surface operations
Across FedEx, we aim to build a ground fleet that
is efficient, sustainable, and tailored to meet our
operational and customer needs. In selecting the
ideal vehicle solution for each application, we
carefully consider local regulatory requirements,
manufacturing options, vehicle use, and operating
and maintenance costs.
Emissions related to our owned and contracted
vehicles account for about 25% of our total footprint.
In FY24, we achieved 40% improvement in vehicle
fuel efficiency compared to a 2005 baseline. Due to
changes in the mix of vehicles needed as a result of
Network 2.0 and other ongoing strategic initiatives,
we do not believe we will be able to achieve our goal
of a 50% increase in vehicle fuel efficiency by 2025.
We continue to review and optimize our sustainability
strategies regarding surface operations to determine
our best path towards our goal of achieving carbonneutral operations by 2040.
Electrification and alternative fuels present a
significant opportunity to reduce the environmental
impact of our global ground fleet further, which
includes more than 200,000 motorized vehicles
across several vehicle classes, including PUD vehicles,
long-haul trucks, forklifts, airport ground services
equipment, and other off-road vehicles.
Our transition to one FedEx has changed our fleet
makeup and vehicle dispersion, bringing new
opportunities. Our PUD EVs will need to be larger to
accommodate the volume of packages we transport,
which requires larger capacity batteries and higher
energy usage to charge. We are focused on optimizing
the efficiency of our routes by pairing the right vehicle
with the right route to increase efficiency per package.
Pickup and delivery
The continued growth of e-commerce means that the
electrification of our PUD fleet presents a significant
opportunity to address last-mile emissions. Our
owned and contracted PUD fleet accounts for about
18% of our total emissions footprint. Electrification
of PUDs also makes long-term sense for our
business. In addition to reducing tailpipe emissions,
we anticipate a considerable return on investment.
Early analysis demonstrates that the costs related
to electric PUDs are up to 30% less compared
to their combustion engine counterparts. This
number could increase as the cost to purchase EVs
drops over time.
While we are in our transformation, we will continue
to take a phased approach to electrification: 50%
of all FedEx PUD purchase orders are targeted to
be electric in 2025, and this is targeted to rise to
100% by 2030. Our goal is to transform our entire
PUD fleet to all electric vehicles by 2040, including
owned and contracted vehicles.
After concluding our executive-level review, we
now anticipate meeting our 2025 goal, while
continuing to work to fine-tune the size and
makeup of our fleet. After a successful U.S. pilot,

across international markets including Australia,
Brazil, Canada, France, the Netherlands, New
Zealand, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom.
Additionally, we added e-cargo bicycles and tricycles
in Canada, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom in FY24.
FedEx 2025 Corporate Responsibility Report 22
years, we’ve expanded our efforts to offer alternative
drop-in fuels internationally. For example, in FY24, we
refueled more than 170 tractor-trailer combinations in
the United Kingdom with hydrotreated vegetable oil
(HVO) after successful pilots in the United Kingdom and
the Netherlands. The change to HVO will deliver certified
lifecycle carbon emissions savings of at least 80%
compared to diesel. Moving forward, we will continue to
trial new solutions to evaluate the best options to reduce
reliance of heavy goods vehicles on fossil fuels.
Charging infrastructure
As we electrify our vehicle fleet, the availability of
adequate charging infrastructure at our facilities is a top
priority. Our vehicles and facilities teams are collaborating
with power utilities, government officials at all levels,
and regulatory agencies to plot a path forward. As the
8,01 8,018 8
on- and off-road EVs operating in FY24
Long-haul fleet
We are actively looking at a number of different
solutions that both reduce the impact of our long-haul
fleet and meet the higher mileage and timely refueling
or recharging requirements that are essential to our
long-haul operations. In 2023 and early 2024, we took
delivery of 36 Class 7 and 8 heavy-duty EV trucks,
and we plan to add 23 more in FY25. Additionally, in
the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, we piloted
eActros 300 electric tractors from Mercedes-Benz
Trucks to test different vehicle specifications and sizes
and better understand how these solutions can best
be applied to our linehaul operations in Europe.
In the U.S., FedEx offers a blend of biodiesel to our
independent service providers to help them access
cost-effective solutions to reduce emissions. In recent
makeup and size of our fleet is changing, our charging
infrastructure will also need to change. The enterprise
is coordinating a collaborative strategy to expedite
the transition to EVs for independent service providers
while rolling out the correct essential infrastructure.
To implement the large-scale charging infrastructure
required for our operations, we are collaborating
closely with local utility companies and regulators to
strategically plan for and meet the additional grid
capacity challenges. For example, FedEx has donated
over $2.5 million since 2021 to help RMI develop
GridUp, a state-of-the-art public grid planning tool.
Launched in 2024, the tool is specifically designed to
help policymakers, utilities, and regulators forecast
energy and power demand from vehicle electrification,
enabling proactive grid investments to support EV
charging needs for fleet owners like FedEx.
While the growth in EV charging will lead to an
increase in our electricity usage, we are investing
in energy management systems and renewable
energy generation and procurement to address
this challenge. See the Facilities section for more
information on these initiatives.

Facilities
FedEx operates more than 5,000 air and ground
hubs, local stations, freight service centers, and retail
locations. In FY24, emissions related to our facilities
accounted for about 6% of our total footprint.
Through effective energy and waste management,
renewable energy procurement, and resiliency efforts,
we are working to reduce the impact of our physical
footprint, reduce costs, and meet customer demands.
As part of our journey to reach carbon neutral
operations globally in 2040, we aim to source 100%
of our facility energy from renewable sources. This
year, we’ve introduced key interim targets to meet
this goal. By 2028, we aim to source 500 gigawatthours (GWh) of energy from renewable sources, rising
to 1,300 GWh by 2033.
Our transition to one FedEx and implementation
of Network 2.0 will support our sustainability
efforts through the minimization of operational
redundancies and reduction in our overall physical
footprint. We continue to work on unifying
environmental management practices across
our operations and follow our Environmental Policy
to integrate environmental stewardship into our daily
operations and business decisions.
Energy and waste management
We are focused on responsibly managing our facility
energy use and waste generation across our global
operations. We utilize a variety of strategies to
improve our performance including enterprise-wide
programs, such as broad implementation of ISO
standards and energy management systems, as well
as inspiring our individual team members to identify
innovations that drive real savings.
In FY24, FedEx sites across 26 countries and
territories maintained compliance with the ISO
14001 environmental management system standard,
highlighting our longstanding commitment to
environmental sustainability. Additionally, we earned
the ISO 9001 global certification for 30 consecutive
years—a status never achieved before in the entire
transport industry. This certification was awarded
for our effective quality management system, which
promotes efficiency by streamlining processes to
improve resource management and reduce waste.
Energy management systems at our facilities also
play a key role to optimize lighting and heating,
ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) equipment.
In FY24, we invested $7 million to upgrade our
facilities with LED lighting retrofits and install newer,
more efficient HVAC systems. We are also exploring
technology that has the potential to significantly
reduce the fan energy required at our commercial
business operations. Since FY17, we reduced the
energy consumption at participating FedEx Office
stores by 47% through the implementation of energy
management systems and LED lighting.
We challenge our individual team members to find
new ways to improve efficiencies and equip them
with Quality Driven Management (QDM) tools to
assist in identifying waste. QDM tools are designed
to drive continuous improvement and, in many
cases, successful ideas become integrated across
our networks. For example, in FY24, a team piloted
a project that introduced mesh reusable bags into
the small package sort systems at our ground hubs.
This initiative generated over $20 million in savings
and prevented 50 million plastic bags from entering
landfills in FY24. In 2025, we will begin using these
reusable bags at our Memphis hub and are looking to
roll out the program globally.

We also integrate energy efficiency specifications and
on-site renewable energy generation options into the
design of new facilities, including principles from the
LEED standard in the U.S. and the Building Research
Establishment Environmental Assessment Method
(BREEAM) standard in Europe. In FY24, our newly
renovated headquarters in Shanghai, China received
LEED certification as well as our new 1.3 million
square-foot sorting facility at our Memphis Hub.
FedEx 2025 Corporate Responsibility Report 24
OUR FACILITIES GOALS
Renewable energy procurement
We invest in both on- and off-site renewable energy
generation and procurement of renewable energy.
The pace of these investments is designed to grow in
the coming years to address our increased electricity
demands. Looking ahead, by 2028, we aim to source
500 GWh of energy from renewable sources, rising
to 1,300 GWh by 2033. By 2040, our goal is source
to all electricity used at our facilities from renewable
sources through both on- and off-site arrangements.
In FY24, we completed contracts to produce
approximately eight additional MWs of renewable
energy across the U.S in FY25. Additionally, we
generated over 31 GWh of on- and off-site solar
energy at 34 locations around the world. While not
all solar installed in our facilities directly powers our
operations, it does increase the supply of renewable
energy in the communities where we operate and, in
many cases, leads to overall energy savings.
Multiple factors need to be considered when
determining the viability of on-site renewable energy,
including grid system design capabilities, differing
real estate models and utility markets, facility leasing
terms, and state and local renewable energy policies
and incentives. At our leased facilities, we work closely
with third-party solar companies that install or offer
solar energy to tenants through partnerships with
commercial landlords.
Facility resiliency
We are committed to embedding resiliency in our
operations as the physical risks of climate change
increase, causing extreme weather events, strain
on electricity grids, and higher energy costs. We
invest in infrastructure reinforcement to meet
growing electricity demand and evolving renewable
generation standards, in addition to mitigating the
potential for storm damage. We also continuously
enhance our contingency planning to address the
impacts of severe weather more quickly. For example,

in February 2024, when a winter storm disrupted
operations at our Memphis hub, we were able to
leverage learnings from a similar storm the prior
year to divert packages more efficiently. While the
2024 storm was twice as long as the one in 2023, we
increased our volume processing speed by 50%. Our
enhanced exiting plans allowed us to hand off over
2.2 million packages and 2.5 million pounds of freight
during the weather event, helping secure customer
trust. This effort is another example of how our teams
deploy QDM tools effectively to remove waste and
improve the sustainability of our operations.
We are also investigating innovative microgrid
solutions for on-site energy generation that can be
leveraged during outages. Our teams are installing
natural gas generators, combined heat and power
systems, and natural gas fuel cell technologies. In
2024, we added a second fuel cell to our Rialto,
California facility, which, combined with other on-site
generation technologies, will meet approximately
51% of the building’s electricity needs. We plan to
install an additional natural gas generator at our
Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania facility in 2025.
FedEx 2025 Corporate Responsibility Report 25
Sustainable customer solutions
We are responsible for handling more than 17 million
shipments per day, on average, and we recognize
that transporting goods for our customers can lead
to environmental impacts through emissions and
waste generation. The solutions we offer can promote
sustainable end-user consumer behaviors while meeting
the needs of a growing e-commerce market and
increasing consumer demand for sustainable products.
Sustainable packaging
We embed circularity principles into our package
design to minimize our environmental impact
while protecting shipments from damage and loss.
Our more sustainable packaging choices, such as the
resealable Reusable Padded Pak, give our customers
more choice to reduce waste associated with their
shipping and returns.
To help ensure we are sourcing our packaging
materials responsibly, we seek relevant third-party
certifications and review these certifications biannually. The FedEx Sourcing team also conducts
annual reviews of our critical supplier’s environmental
management practices and sustainability programs,
including recommending improvement areas.
To help with broader adoption of circularity
principles, FedEx and Pyxera Global launched the
Circular Supply Chain Coalition to transform supply
chains and scale the upcycling of rare earth minerals
from consumer electronic waste and material with
commoditized value. The initiative aims to establish
and scale remanufacturing hubs, support local
circular enterprises and entrepreneurs, and create
high-skill job opportunities, setting a new standard
for regenerative supply chains.
Customer sustainability insights
Our FedEx® Sustainability Insights tool provides
customers and suppliers access to estimated CO2e
emissions data associated with eligible shipments in
the FedEx network—from the individual package to
account levels. This tool enables greater transparency
for customers to inform their emissions reporting,
understand their carbon footprint, and make
informed decisions about their shipping patterns.
Additionally, U.S.-based customers can forecast future
emissions through predictive modeling capabilities.
Launched globally in FY24, FedEx® Sustainability
Insights is currently translated into 34 languages and
available in over 100 markets, including several in APAC
and the Middle East, Indian Subcontinent, and Africa
(MEISA), and all LAC markets. Since July 2023, over
13,000 customers have generated emissions reports
from the tool, either directly on www.fedex.com or

with the help of their sales representative. Providing
our customers with this level of information empowers
them to gain a better understanding of their Scope 3
emissions generated from their shipping activities with
us and to plan ahead for future improvements.
We are also working to make supply chains and
shipping options smarter and more efficient for
customers through AI and robotics technologies.
For example, in FY24 FedEx launched a data-driven
e-commerce platform, called fdx, to help businesses
of all sizes across the U.S. manage end-to-end
customer journeys. The platform’s data-driven
insights are designed to help businesses optimize
fulfillment through near real-time shipping data,
improve supply chain sustainability with carbon
emissions data, and streamline product returns.
Additionally, through FedEx Dataworks, we can
provide estimated delivery dates so customers can
request to reroute shipments or enable Hold at
Location if they will not be available for a delivery,
which can reduce missed delivery attempts.

Quality of life
We promote the health, safety, and well-being of our
people through integrated benefit offerings that apply
to everyday life, both inside and outside of work. By
meeting the unique needs of our employees, we can
attract and retain best-in-class talent to drive business
results for our customers. Our comprehensive benefits
include health care coverage, well-being programs,
basic and supplemental life and accidental death and
dismemberment insurance, paid sick leave, paid time
off, and parental leave for all eligible full- and part-time
employees. We adhere to all wage and labor laws in the
countries and territories where we operate to ensure
fair living wages.
In FY24, we formed a global Total Rewards team
that evaluates, manages, and promotes the benefits
available to all FedEx employees. We are assessing
current offerings across all regions and have begun
harmonizing and enhancing our suite of benefits
programs where possible.
We encourage our plan members to provide feedback
on our time-off benefits so we can refine our offerings
to fully support our employees. Our teams also analyze
survey data at the local, national, and enterprise levels
and conduct routine peer benchmarking and internal
pay equity analyses to incorporate best practices, keep
abreast of regulatory developments, and develop
competitive offerings.
In the U.S., we cover approximately 70% of total eligible
health costs at the plan level for more than 350,000
enrolled employees and dependents as of January
2025. These health benefits include flexible medical,
behavioral, dental, vision, and pharmacy coverage, in
addition to mental health services.
We are committed to providing benefits that work
best for our unique employee population, with
employee contributions and deductibles in the
U.S. below the national average. “Your Choice,”
our copay-only medical plan option, connects plan
members to quality providers through flexible, simple,
and transparent offerings with lower employee
contributions compared to our other medical plans.
The Your Choice plan option has no deductible,
no coinsurance, and $0 employee paycheck
contributions for the Employee Only coverage tier,
and it has reduced employee paycheck contributions
for Employee & Children and Employee & Family
coverage tiers. We also offer plans that focus on
specific areas of medical support, like our lifestyle
management program which makes weight loss
medication more accessible, and our Choose Well
Care Connect advocacy program which provides

In FY24, we broadened our tuition assistance
program across the U.S. for all employees, which
now includes a streamlined process for submission
and reimbursement to over 200 schools and access
to free advisory services to support employees
interested in gaining higher education.
As part of one FedEx, we established a global
process for performance management to provide
timely work-related feedback and assist in career
growth. Under this process, managers and their
employees have multiple touchpoints throughout
the year and meet at the end of each fiscal year
to evaluate performance against expectations
and set new goals. Performance evaluations at the
end of each fiscal year are tied to our rewards and
recognition program.
Learning and development
We are committed to helping our team members
grow and develop their careers at FedEx. We are
constantly adapting our offerings to meet current
company needs and prepare capabilities we anticipate
needing in the future. By focusing on the learning and
development of our employees, we hope to increase
engagement and retention and strengthen our internal
talent pipeline, while enabling our team members to
better deliver on the Purple Promise for our customers.
In FY24, our retail new hire trainings included pointof-sale enhancements to increase efficiency and
improve both the customer and team member
experience. We also offer power skills courses to
educate front-line workers, operations managers,
engineers, engineering specialists, and human
resource professionals on topics such as emotional

that houses thousands of easily accessible online
courses available to all team members. This third-party,
data-driven system not only enables efficient learning
opportunities for our employees but also allows us to
track progress on employee learning goals.
We implement programs and initiatives for our
executives that focus on leadership skills, succession
planning, and fostering institutional knowledge to
facilitate engagement, career growth, and strong
leadership. This year, we launched our global
succession management process for executives.
The program reached all of our officers and
directors globally and included leadership learning
hubs and strength-based leadership coaching.
Looking forward, we plan to add an enterprise-wide
leadership development program for high-potential
officers and directors in FY26. We also responded
to team member feedback by consolidating the
manager onboarding process.

Our culture and people
Our culture
Our unified culture has enabled us to drive
progress and innovation for over 50 years. At the
foundation of our culture is our People-ServiceProfit philosophy—the belief that creating an
environment where people are valued and have
an opportunity to succeed leads to exceptional
service, which generates the profitability to fund
our future and reward our people. Our team
members span geographies and backgrounds
yet we are united by a common goal—the Purple
Promise, which is our commitment to make every
FedEx experience outstanding.
One way we ensure understanding and buyin of our culture is by conducting workshops
for leaders and team members across the
enterprise. This year, we held dedicated
workshops for operations leaders in Canada prior
to the implementation of Network 2.0. These
workshops focused on equipping each leader to
support their teams, drive business results, and
champion our culture of one FedEx. Our leaders
reported feeling more prepared to navigate the
road ahead, demonstrating how our commitment
to fostering culture supports business priorities.
At FedEx, culture is a strategic asset and a
key enabler. As we transform for the future,
continuing to embed our values across the
enterprise remains a top priority.

STRATEGIC PILLARS
Equality, Opportunity, and Diversity are the bedrock of our culture
FedEx is—and has been since its founding in 1971—committed to equality, opportunity, and diversity. This is about
much more than our policies and practices. This is about our long-standing culture and steadfast belief that when we
give everyone the opportunity to grow and advance in their careers, our team members thrive and FedEx prospers.
Equality, opportunity, and diversity are interwoven across our four strategic pillars which are: Our People; Our
Education and Engagement; Our Communities, Customers, and Suppliers; and Our Story.
Our people
We value our differences and believe every voice
counts. With more than 500,000 team members in
over 220 countries and territories, these differences
are a source of strength and creativity. Each
international region has councils that leverage these
unique perspectives and embed culture, equality,
opportunity, and diversity across business operations.
In FY24, the APAC and MEISA regions partnered with
the Stanford Neurodiversity Project, which develops
the skills of neurodiverse individuals to empower
success in their daily lives. In LAC, we released the
“MY VOICE” podcast to facilitate fresh conversations
with frontline employees and individual contributors
to increase awareness and education about inclusion
and opportunities.
See the Human resource management section for
more details on our hiring practices and the Data
appendix and our EEO-1 Reports for additional
information.
Our education and engagement
At FedEx, we take care of each other by providing
continuing education opportunities to progress all
team members’ careers and enhancing our culture in
which everyone is treated with dignity, courtesy, and
respect across the enterprise. Our learning platform
provides simplified content for all career levels.
We also cultivate a learning environment for
leadership by providing resources such as equality,
opportunity, and diversity practice toolkits and
forums where leaders share insights and best
practices to build trust.
The Purple Pathways Program is an internal career
track program to provide opportunities for the
development and growth of our team members.
Supported by over 4,800 Purple Pathways mentors
and champions, more than 62,000 team members
have enrolled as participants in the program since
its inception.
FedEx offers a variety of Employee Resource Groups
(ERGs), which are open to all FedEx employees, and
provide a unique blend of social, educational, and
professional opportunities that support personal
and professional growth and business objectives.
We also include culture equality, opportunity and
diversity-related questions within our engagement
surveys to better understand all perspectives in our
workforce and integrate employee feedback into
our initiatives.
See the Learning and development section for
more information regarding employee training and
initiatives to support continued employee education.

Our communities, customers, and suppliers
Addressing local needs and societal challenges in
communities around the world is important to us. We
collaborate with nonprofits that strive to ensure access
to opportunities for everyone, while encouraging our
employees to contribute their time and skills through
volunteering where they live, work, and serve. Our goal
is to cultivate a world in which everyone is treated with
dignity, courtesy, and respect.
Together with a group of nonprofits, we help create
economic mobility, advance belonging and allyship,
and provide access to education and learning.
 International Youth Foundation (IYF): We
began working with the IYF in 2018 to create
a curriculum that blends hands-on technical
training in logistics with essential life skills, such as
problem-solving, leadership, and teamwork. The
program has transformed the lives of thousands
of underserved youth in cities across Mexico and
El Salvador, setting a new standard for workforce
development and providing top talent for
transportation companies, including FedEx.
 U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation’s Hiring
Our Heroes (HOH): Our nation’s veterans, service
members, and military spouses often face complex
barriers to civilian employment. FedEx works with
HOH to provide transitioning service members and
their spouses with professional training, hands-on
work experience, networking, and direct connections
to employers through HOH Career Summits and the
HOH Corporate Fellowship Program.
 Dress for Success® Worldwide (DFS): We are
a longtime supporter of DFS, which provides
mentorship, leadership development, and
entrepreneurial development to create an
environment in which women and girls can excel.
FedEx helped co-create and launch the FedEx
Career Hub, an online tool to help women access
job services such as creating a résumé, searching
for positions, and preparing for an interview
remotely, all on their own schedule. In addition to
supporting DFS Worldwide, FedEx supports local
programs in Memphis and Dallas.
 FedEx College Pathways Career Expos:
Our College Pathways program provides students
with an opportunity to speak with FedEx leaders
regarding various topics, such as transitioning
from college to a career at FedEx. We offer
students virtual and in-person career experiences
that align with their academic pursuits, reaching
nearly 385 students to date.
 FedEx-Historically Black Colleges and Universities
Student Ambassador Program: We provide access
to resources and equip college students with
career and leadership tools to help them enter the
professional workforce upon graduation.
 FedEx High School Pathways: We expand our pool
of candidates through early outreach to high school
students. Our High School Pathways program
builds brand awareness, exposes students to
various career paths at FedEx, strengthens FedEx
relationships with local communities, and reinforces
current proactive recruitment strategies by
attracting talent to FedEx. Since its launch in 2022,
over 5,500 students from 113 high schools have
participated in this program.
As one FedEx, we have the power to support a global
supplier base, which includes small businesses. See
the Supply chain section for information on our
supplier program.
Our story
At FedEx, our workforce embodies the rich diversity
of the global community that we serve and in which
we operate. With team members hailing from
different continents and cultures, shining a light on
their diverse stories highlights how we deliver—as
one FedEx team.
We foster awareness of and connection to our culture
and team members across our global organization
through internal communications, feature stories, and
other channels.
In FY24, our impact was recognized through several
awards, including Best for Vets Employers by the
Military Times, Women in Trucking, Women’s Business
Enterprise National Council, and the National Business
Inclusion Consortium’s Best of the Best.

Health and safety
At FedEx, the health, safety, and well-being of
our team members and service providers are top
priorities. We foster safety within our operations, on
the road, and in surrounding communities to help
reduce the frequency and severity of accidents and
injuries. Our business decisions are informed by
our Safety Above All philosophy, which is integrated
in our health and safety policies, technology
investments, risk evaluation processes, training
programs, recognition, and awards. The Governance,
Safety, and Public Policy Committee of the FedEx
Board of Directors regularly reviews operational
safety metrics and performance within the company
and discusses safety-related programs and
developments with management. We also work with
regulatory agencies to promote proper compliance
with safe work requirements.
Safety management systems
Our safety management systems (SMSs) help us
initiate and monitor health and safety programming
across our operations with a key focus on reducing
work-related injuries and illnesses and complying with
safety regulations. Our SMSs are tailored to address
specific hazards and regulatory environments
depending on the activities of each facility. We are
working to align multiple safety policies across our
enterprise to support the transition to one FedEx.
At the corporate level, our executive team uses
SMSs to review enterprise-wide health and safety
performance each quarter, and our operations use
centralized data processes to track and mitigate
incidents. We also have internal Safety committees
which conduct monthly site inspections and periodic
safety performance reviews, in addition to Operations
Safety Specialists, Field Safety Advisors, and Driver
Advisors who develop optimal safety strategies
through site-specific method and documentation
assessments. Additionally, FedEx uses field-based
controlled self-monitoring to validate execution of
our safety programs and identify how to improve and
focus safety-related trainings.
We understand the importance of identifying
and mitigating safety risks across our operations.
The FedEx Safety and Design Engineering teams
proactively incorporate risk mitigation into equipment
and operating procedure design. We are working
to unify our annual risk assessments across the
enterprise to help prioritize operational and supply
chain safety strategies.
FedEx has various strategies and programs in place
to engage our employees and strengthen safe work
methods. For example, employees and managers
use safety observations to reinforce proper lifting
techniques to reduce injuries, and this will be rolled
out to additional operations in FY25. Our Safety
department also creates content for frontline
managers to conduct daily pre-sort messaging and
stretching exercises, as well as courier and yard
equipment operator coaching, to build a foundation
of safe work behaviors and reduce injuries.
Our cutting-edge technology enhances visibility of
unsafe behaviors and mitigates risks. In São Paulo,
Brazil we are testing electric vans equipped with AI
alerts that communicate with police and emergency
response teams to protect against cargo and vehicle
theft, protecting our employees, vehicles, and
customer shipments. Additionally, we plan to pilot AI
capabilities within vehicles that can alert and validate
operational safety behaviors in FY25.

Our team members embed the FedEx Safety Abo
ve
All philosophy in all that they do. Our en
terprise

o
versight, programs, and trainings promo
te positive
safety behaviors to reinfor
ce this culture.
We prioritize health and safety from the start,
with manda
tory safety trainings for all new hir
e
s
during onboarding. We utilize additional in-person
trainings as well as live, virtual sessions to engage
and equip emplo
yees with the tools nec
essary t
o
addr
ess their work- and r
esponsibility-specific
safety hazards. The Leading with Safety program teaches managers proper safety procedure execution, hazard recognition and reporting, and
how to e
xercise stop
-
work authority to facilita
t
e
safe working conditions among their teams. W
e
also pr
ovide an Ergonomic Risk Mitigation program
to reduce risk of injury and discomfort as well as
trainings to impr
o
ve workplace efficiencies, reduc
e

yee morale.
As a k
ey member of the transportation industry,
we prioritize driver safety training, technology, and
ac
countability through our Safer High
w
a
ys str
a
tegy,
which impr
o
v
es accident r
a
t
es and pr
o
tects our
workers and communities. Within our oper
ations,
the FedEx Office of T
ransportation Safety offers the
FOCUS Safe Driving Program to teach defensive
driving techniques. We also utilize the Vehicle Event
Data Recorder (VEDR) Program for managers to review and address driver behavior, enhancing the
safety of drivers and others on the road. In 2024, FedEx saw a 2.7% year-over-year improvement in
the PUD pr
e
ventable vehicle accident r
a
te, as well
as a 74% impr
o
vement in distracted driving e
vents
since implementation of the VEDR Program in 2021.
To further embed the messages and skills learned
in safety trainings, we facilita
te regular emplo
yee
engagements through dialogue with managers, feedback avenues, and safe behavior recognition
channels. For e
xample, team members can pr
ovide
feedback on our safety culture through the bi-annual
global Aviation Safety Culture Surv
e
y, which we use
to identify safety risks and opportunities and crea
te
action plans. Additionally, our Stay Sharp emplo
yee
recognition program is one w
ay we celebr
a
te
emplo
yees who model safe behaviors.
As another means to enhance our oper
ational safety
measur
es, we pr
ovide a Qualific
ation Certific
ation to
service pr
ovider drivers, pr
oving they are qualified to
oper
a
te their designa

1 Waste at many of our facilities is difficult to track because it is collected by haulers contracted by a landlord or local municipality, or
commingled with other tenants’ waste in shared facilities such as airports and retail malls, and as such has not been included in this data.
2 Non-hazardous waste data includes the solid waste (non-regulated/trash) and non-hazardous regulated waste categories that were
reported separately in previous reports.
3 Hazardous waste data includes the hazardous (regulated) waste, universal waste (which encompasses certain hazardous waste items,

CAUTIONARY NOTE
Certain statements in this report may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, such as statements relating to expected cost savings, the optimization
of our network through Network 2.0, the planned spin-off of the FedEx Freight business into a new independent
publicly traded company, future financial and operational targets, business strategies, management’s views with
respect to future events and financial performance, and underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements include
those preceded by, followed by, or that include the words “will,” “may,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “believes,” “expects,”
“forecasts,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “estimates,” “targets,” “projects,” “intends,” or similar expressions. Such forwardlooking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors which could cause actual results to differ
materially from historical experience or from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
Potential risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, our ability to successfully implement our business
strategy (including with respect to sustainability, human resource management, and safety), effectively respond to
changes in market dynamics and achieve the anticipated benefits and associated cost savings of such strategies
and actions; our ability to meet certain goals relating to aircraft emissions, vehicle fuel efficiency, alternative fuels
and renewable energy, and aircraft and vehicle fleet modernization within the currently projected costs and the
expected timeframes, including our goal of carbon-neutral operations by 2040; the availability and cost of and our
ability to acquire and/or leverage alternative fuel vehicles, alternative fuels, fuel-efficient aircraft, global electrical
charging infrastructure and requisite power grid capacity, off-site renewable energy, and other materials and
components, which may be adversely affected by ongoing international conflicts or terrorist activities and disruptions
in global supply chains; changes in U.S. or international trade policy; unforeseen production, design, operational, and
technological difficulties; the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments, including the ability
to scale projects and technologies on a commercially competitive basis such as carbon sequestration and/or other
related processes and projects utilizing artificial intelligence and machine learning; compliance with, and changes or
additions to, global and regional regulations, taxes, charges, mandates, or requirements relating to GHG emissions,
carbon costs, or climate-related goals; labor-related regulations and requirements that restrict or prohibit our ability
to impose requirements on third parties who provide contracted transportation for our transportation networks;
adapting products to customer preferences and customer acceptance of sustainable supply chain solutions; the
actions of competitors and competitive pressures; the development and perception of markets for carbon offset
credits; and other factors which can be found in FedEx Corp.’s and our subsidiaries’ press releases and FedEx Corp.’s
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the
date on which it is made. We do not undertake or assume any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking
statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
Note on materiality: Materiality, as used in this report, and our ESG priority assessment process, is different from the
definition used in the context of filings with the SEC. Issues deemed material for purposes of this report may not be
considered material for SEC reporting purposes.
Cost savings related to aircraft modernization and efficiency efforts are calculated by multiplying the total gallons
saved by the average price of jet fuel per gallon in the respective year.
