# AI & NLP Exam Project â€“ ESG and Risk Classification

## Overview

This repository contains the final exam project for the course **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (KAN-CINTO4003U)** at Copenhagen Business School, Fall 2025. The project explores the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniquesâ€”including Bag of Words (BoW), BERT, and large language models (LLMs)â€”to classify and extract information from corporate ESG reports and 10-K filings.

## Objective

The primary objective of the project is to assess the effectiveness of different NLP approaches in identifying ESG-related content and evaluating corporate risk exposure. We compare traditional and modern NLP techniques across multiple datasets to analyze their performance in classification and information extraction tasks.

## Data Sources

- **ESG Reports**: Manually downloaded from official company websites.
- **10-K Filings**: Retrieved via the SEC API at [https://sec-api.io](https://sec-api.io).

## Methodology

We implemented and compared the following methods:

- **BoW + Logistic Regression**: A classic baseline approach using term frequency vectors.
- **BERT-based Classification**: Fine-tuning pretrained transformer models for ESG/risk labeling.
- **LLM Zero-Shot / Few-Shot**: Using decoder-only large language models (e.g., GPT-4, WatsonX) to extract and classify text without explicit fine-tuning.

## Results

The results showed that LLMs outperformed traditional methods in capturing nuanced ESG-related content and context-dependent risk indicators, particularly in unstructured report sections. However, BERT models provided a competitive balance of performance and efficiency in structured classification tasks.
